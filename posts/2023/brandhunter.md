I saw a petition going around asking Netflix to finally make season 3 of _Mindhunter_. I doubt that will happen considering how costly that show was to produce, but I would love to see it.

It did jog my memory that I had started and never shipped a little project I intended to call “Brandhunter.” Like other Netflix shows, _Mindhunter_ had some pretty intense product placement. Much more fun to spot in this show though, with really detailed 1970s and ’80s era design and packaging.

I ended up tracking all the brands that pop up—from many defunct companies and plenty of still thriving ones. I appreciated the more subtle world building some brands provided, but I especially loved the record scratch, take-you-out-of-the-scene product placement.

Maybe if they make a season 3, I’ll end up shipping this project for real, but in the meantime here are a few of my faves:
