The tech industry loves stickers and so do I. Lisa Frank really had us hoarding stickers at an early age. Like many others before me, I can never decide where to put them. There’s only so much laptop surface area and the permanence of it all feels daunting.

I looked into some ways of finally using them. I don’t have the courage to go full [David Darnes](https://darn.es/) and do the sticker desk, though I absolutely love how it looks.

Of the options I saw, fridge magnets felt like a safe and easy thing to try. So this weekend I got some [adhesive magnet sheets](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09ZLPQLRN?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) and gave it a go.

It was pretty simple. Peel the sticker, peel the magnet, stick them together, cut.

Turned out decent enough. If you look too closely you might be like, did a child cut these? Related, I recommend extremely sharp scissors. The easier ones were the ones I could use a straight edge and X-ACTO knife. But, it’s better than having them sit in a drawer hidden away.

Should I cover the entire fridge? Just might.
