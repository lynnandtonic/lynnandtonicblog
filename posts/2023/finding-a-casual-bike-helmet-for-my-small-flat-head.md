Iâ€™ve been having trouble finding a bicycle helmet that fits well. Iâ€™ve got a pretty small head, the circumference measurement just barely making it into the Adult Small sizes for some brands and Kids sizes for others. Itâ€™s also quite flat in the back (hats and headbands never quite stay put either).

I tried a few brands that didnâ€™t quite work. Some customer service folks and my neighborhood bike shop suggested DIY padding options. I posed the question on Mastodon and [Gabrielle Wee suggested](https://elk.zone/front-end.social/@gabriellewee@mas.to/109796985378121731) I search for _Asian-fit helmets_.

Interesting! That turned up a bunch of info and turns out, itâ€™s not just a _me_ problem. Hereâ€™s a diagram from [Karmore Sports](https://karmor-sports.com/asianfit):

I did some searching but ran into a few obstacles:
- Stores in my area donâ€™t carry them.
- A lot of online retailers only carried medium to large sizes.
- There were a lot of snowboard helmet options but not bicycle.
- The bicycle ones were for serious cyclists (definitely not me, I have a one-speed beach cruiser).

A bit of a bummer, but I was able to try some helmets on in person and turns out the ones with the little dial fitter in the back were a great alternative. I tried [Smith](https://www.smithoptics.com/en_US/p/helmet/persist-road-helmet/E007560XS5155.html) brand ones and those were comfy, but I ended up with this one from [Thousand](https://www.explorethousand.com/products/bike-helmet?color=speedway-creme&size=small) because I liked the price and the look:

<small class="footnotes center">See the dial?</small>

Maybe this dial thing is old news, but Iâ€™m new to bike helmets and none of the bike stores I talked to recommended it! It made the helmet really snug and it wouldnâ€™t budge. I hope I donâ€™t ever have to test it, but it feels great and Iâ€™ve been comfortably riding the last couple days.

So for my fellow flat-headed people, maybe try a helmet with the little dial in the back. ðŸš²
