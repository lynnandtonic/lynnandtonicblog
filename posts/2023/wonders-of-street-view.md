[Neal Agarwal](https://nealagarwal.me/) is one of my favorite people on the web. He makes weird interactive projects over at [neal.fun](https://neal.fun/) and his latest is a joy to explore.

It’s called [Wonders of Street View](https://neal.fun/wonders-of-street-view/) and drops you into Google Street View at curated spots. You can click around and explore for hours, trust me. There are a bunch of neat places and things to see and my favorites are...

The road side attractions:

![Swole Bus in Prague, Czechia: a red double decker bus with two buff arms coming out the side](/img/wonders-of-street-view-1.jpg)
![Miniature Carnival in Hamburg, Germany: a very detailed model of a tiny carnival](/img/wonders-of-street-view-6.jpg)

The absolutely gorgeous natural wonders:

![Blue Forest in Flemish Brabant, Belgium: forest of tall but narrow trees and the ground is covered in blue flowers](/img/wonders-of-street-view-9.jpg)

The distant places I will never see in person:

![Space Views from the International Space Station: a view of Earth from the space station window](/img/wonders-of-street-view-3.jpg)
![Summit at Mount Everest: a handful of climbers at the peak](/img/wonders-of-street-view-7.jpg)

The captures at the perfect moment:

![Tripping in Nova Scotia, Canada: a man is mid fall after tripping on the sidewalk](/img/wonders-of-street-view-4.jpg)
![The Hopper in Myślenice County, Poland: a rabbit is leaping in the air](/img/wonders-of-street-view-5.jpg)

And of course I love a [Google glitch](/2011/03/08/postcards-from-google-maps/):

![Tripod Man in Ontario, Canada: glitchy capture of a guy leaning into the backseat of his car and he has three legs](/img/wonders-of-street-view-8.jpg)

Of course there are tons more delightful and beautiful places to explore, so check it out!
