A lot of great movies came out in 2022, with a couple that will surely make my best of the decade list too. I didn’t make it to the cinema as much as I hoped, but this was definitely the year to watch from home cuddled on the couch with the pups.

Some honorable mentions for 2022 include _Top Gun: Maverick_ for helping me wait things out until _Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning_ comes out next year, _Slumberland_, _Nope_, _The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent_, and _Spirited_ (whose soundtrack I listened to a whole bunch).
