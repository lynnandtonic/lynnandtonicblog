Before [our dog Helo](/2023/01/03/helo-3/) passed away earlier this year, Clay and I had decided that, whenever the time came, we would cremate our dogs but opt not to receive their ashes. We discussed it and felt good about our decision. And when Helo died, we stuck to the plan.

But god dammit it _hurt_. A couple days later we both looked at each other and knew weâ€™d changed our minds. Luckily it was a one phone call fix and it felt like a huge weight had been lifted.

Grief just isnâ€™t rational at all. Maybe years from now weâ€™ll scatter his ashes somewhere, but for now, it feels right having them with us.

So then I went down a rabbit hole looking for unique urns and I found [Barruntando Ceramics](https://www.etsy.com/shop/BarruntandoCeramics) on Etsy, a Spanish ceramics shop that creates painterly, custom urns from photos of your pet. Truly adorable.

Ours finally arrived yesterday and itâ€™s wonderful.

We love having this to look at and to remember our sweet Helo pup. ðŸ’š
