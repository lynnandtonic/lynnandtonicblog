2022 was a good year for television with a bunch of fun new series and one major standout. Some honorable mentions for this list are Maya Rudolph’s _Loot_, anxiety-filled _The Bear_, Rachel Bloom’s _Reboot_, and the adorable _Ms Marvel_. We also had a lot of fun catching up on _LEGO Masters_ (so wholesome) and _Succession_ (not so wholesome).

Here are my fave miniseries and series debuts from 2022.
