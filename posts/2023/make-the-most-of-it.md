On Thursday Clay and I attended our first concert in over three years. 

New Found Glory just released a new [acoustic album](https://orcd.co/6v5lygb). It’s a really great, emotional album written and recorded after Chad almost died and was diagnosed with Pheochromocytoma, a rare cancer that often goes misdiagnosed. Their accompanying tour is raising awareness and funds for the [Pheo Para Alliance](https://pheopara.org/). I knew we had to be there.

They played Celebrity Theatre, an intimate venue known for its revolving stage (stationary for this show, though). It was incredible. A real gift of a show for longtime fans. I only teared up twice: once during _Dressed to Kill_ and once during _Kiss the Floor_ (my fave song from the new album).

Grateful to experience this show and for this music I’ve loved for so much of my life. Hopeful for Chad’s health and for more NFG in the future.

I grabbed some photos from their Instagram to remember the night. Shots by [Ana Massard](https://www.instagram.com/anamassard/).

They played a lot of songs they don’t often play live, so I made a Spotify playlist of their set. Missing from the playlist is _I’ll Be_ (Edwin McCain) which to my knowledge they never recorded.

*Here’s to us fools that have no meaning  
I tip my glass to you  
Let’s toast the night away to friends  
And forget about tomorrow*
