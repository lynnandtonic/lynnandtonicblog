Although I’ve never been one to bother with Valentine’s Day, I am pretty lucky I found such a great person to spend it with. He’s my very best friend: the first person I want to talk to when something good or bad happens, the person who can always make me laugh, and the person who can put up with all my crazy quirks. We’ll probably spend Valentine’s Day watching TV on the couch with the pups and I couldn’t ask for anything better.
