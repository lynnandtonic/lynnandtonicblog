I’ve been examining my [26 before 26](/2010/08/22/26-before-26/) list, trying to determine which items I will complete before my birthday on Tuesday. It was then I realized life had already helped me out with one of them. Joyfully, I am crossing off #12: <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Reconnect with an old friend</span>.

I was introduced to [Kate Farrar](http://katefarrar.tumblr.com/) by a mutual friend in high school. Although we didn’t attend the same school, we saw each other all the time. We shared a love for pop-punk and could easily be found at the same shows or hanging out at the 92nd St. Starbucks/Chipotle. We worked at the same retirement home and she even permanently borrowed a pair of my Converse (even though she doesn’t remember).

I hadn’t talked to or seen her since high school, until earlier this year I discovered we had mutual friends in common still. She came to work at meltmedia and I’m so glad she did. We quickly and easily became friends again, and we discovered our mutual loves for HTML, Star Wars, and not wearing pants. Both of us searched through our old photos to find a picture of the two of us from high school. We each found pictures of the other from nights we _know_ we were both in attendance. But sadly, none of the two of us surfaced. Here’s us now, coworkers and friends again.
