I’ve recently been enjoying [Young Me Now](http://www.zefrank.com/youngmenowme/blog/), a blog that posts photo recreations. I love how it shows the changes over time and also the creativity of the subjects. Then, I discovered _Back to the Future_, a photo project by artist Irina Werning. I was blown away. She takes the same concept, but adds a level of detail that is so impressive, I can’t stop looking. She not only recreates the pose, expression, and location, but also the exact clothing, lighting, color balance, and natural fading that occurs with older photos. So in love with these. Check out her site [www.irinawerning.com](http://irinawerning.com/back-to-the-fut/back-to-the-future/) to view the rest.
