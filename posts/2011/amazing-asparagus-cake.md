I love cake. I love eating it and especially looking at beautiful and intricately crafted display cakes. As shows like _Ace of Cakes_ prove, modern cake decorators are artists and sculptors; their media just happen to be butter cream and fondant. I saw this cake as I was browsing one of my favorite cake blogs (yes, I read cake blogs, leave me alone). This seriously _blows my mind_. One of the greatest illusions Iâ€™ve seen to date and it looks delicious! Scroll down to be amazed and then visit [sweetapolita.com](http://sweetapolita.com/2011/05/for-the-love-of-fondant-asparagus-and-8-layer-cakes/) to view the step-by-step process.
