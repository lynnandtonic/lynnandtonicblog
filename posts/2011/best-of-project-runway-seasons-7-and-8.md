Another collection of my favorite looks from Project Runway seasons 7 and 8. Although I didn’t love season 7, I did enjoy Seth Aaron’s style and Anthony’s hilarious attitude. So many of the designers were boring and forgettable. Season 8 was one of my very favorites. Mondo won me over the second I saw him. His own style was so dorky and endearing, while his designs were stunning, colorful, and whimsical. For the other seasons, see: [seasons 1 and 2](/2011/01/31/best-of-project-runway-seasons-1-and-2/), [seasons 3 and 4](/2011/02/07/best-of-project-runway-seasons-3-and-4/), [seasons 5 and 6](/2011/02/13/best-of-project-runway-seasons-5-and-6/).
