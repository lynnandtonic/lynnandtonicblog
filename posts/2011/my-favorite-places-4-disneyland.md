It’s not called “the Most Magical Place on Earth” for nothing. Disney has had me captivated since I was a child. Their television shows, films, and music engulfed me, transported me to fantastic places. I dreamt of becoming an animator for Disney Studios and getting married in Cinderella’s castle. Visiting Disneyland was a joy: meeting favorite characters in person, escaping pirates of the Caribbean, and taking star tours to the forest moon of Endor. Waiting in line was never a bore; we always had churros and great conversation. Even as an adult, I dream of my next visit to Disneyland. Every year they add new attractions and improve on our favorites, but the true beauty is that Disneyland exists as a place for imagination and fun.
