The Oscars are this weekend. I gave up on the Oscars for a while, as none of my favorites ever won. Iâ€™m hoping this year proves different. Here are the few categories I care about and the films/actors I _hope_ win in the end.

**Best Picture** - _Inception_

**Best Actor in a Leading Role** - Jesse Eisenberg (_The Social Network_)
