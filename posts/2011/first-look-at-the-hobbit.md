_Entertainment Weekly_ recently posted some first look photos of the much anticipated Peter Jackson film _The Hobbit_. Jackson made history with the three _The Lord of the Rings_ films and ever since we’ve been anxious for the completion (and technically the start) of the much lighter and more fun prequel. I was thrilled when Martin Freeman was announced as Bilbo, but I’m not so thrilled the film is being split into two parts. Along with being released a year apart, the films are also set to feature characters who don’t appear in the original book. Regardless, I’m still very excited to see the final product.
