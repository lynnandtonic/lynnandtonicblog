With this year’s Oscars come and gone, it got me thinking about Best Picture winners. In my lifetime, I’ve seen several movies win the award that I just couldn’t stand behind. I love movies that are enjoyable, unique, and innovative. Does the movie say something new? Or does it say something old but in a new way? Could this movie be enjoyed across gender, race, and generation? Will this movie influence others that come after? Here are some Best Pictures winners I disagree with and the films I think _should_ have won (or should at least have been nominated).

1990 Winner: _Dances with Wolves_ -- My Pick: _Edward Scissorhands_  
The fantastic, gentle, and unlikely hero in Edward Scissorhands beats John J. Dunbar anyday. And I love wolves, so that’s saying a lot.

![Forrest Gump / The Shawshank Redemption](/img/oscarwinners2.jpg)

1994 Winner: _Forrest Gump_ -- My Pick: _The Shawshank Redemption_  
This is a tough one, since I love _Forrest Gump_. Both are extraordinary tales of common men, but I do believe _Shawshank_ is a truly perfect movie.

![American Beauty / Fight Club](/img/oscarwinners4.jpg)

1999 Winner: _American Beauty_ -- My Pick: _Fight Club_  
Both films are dark and feature supremely talented casts, but that’s where their commonalities depart. _Fight Club_ is one of the very few movies I like more than its book version.

![A Beautiful Mind / Amélie](/img/oscarwinners5.jpg)

2001 Winner: _A Beautiful Mind_ -- My Pick: _Amélie_  
Not sure this one needs any explanation. The kind of movie that perfectly captures the essence of Paris, loneliness, romance, and joy.

![Chicago / Gangs of New York](/img/oscarwinners6.jpg)

2002 Winner: _Chicago_ -- My Pick: _Gangs of New York_  
Catherine Zeta Jones and her amazing voice shouldn’t have beat out Daniel Day Lewis and his Bill the Butcher.

![Million Dollar Baby / Eternal Sunshine](/img/oscarwinners7.jpg)

2004 Winner: _Million Dollar Baby_ -- My Pick: _Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind_  
_Eternal Sunshine_ is one of the most unique love stories I’ve ever seen. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet were a joy and the storytelling perfect.

![Crash / Any Other Movie](/img/oscarwinners8.jpg)

2005 Winner: _Crash_ -- My Pick: Anything but _Crash_  
_Crash_ was one of the worst movies I’ve ever seen. I desperately wish I had never seen it. When it won the Oscar, a part of me died inside.

![The Departed / Stranger Than Fiction](/img/oscarwinners9.jpg)

2006 Winner: _The Departed_ -- My Pick: _Stranger than Fiction_  
A “you’re going to die, so live” tale with a twist and lovely performance from Will Ferrell. The kind of film that makes you happy about life.

![No Country for Old Men / 300](/img/oscarwinners10.jpg)

2007 Winner: _No Country For Old Men_ -- My Pick: _300_  
Another example of the Academy picking movies that crush my soul. _300_ was inspirational and visually stunning. I’d love if more _actually_ enjoyable movies won the big award.
