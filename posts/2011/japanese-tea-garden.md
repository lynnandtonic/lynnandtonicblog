During our short visit to San Francisco for Christmas, we took an even shorter trip into the city for an evening of missed opportunities. We tried to see the Musée d’Orsay exhibition at the de Young Museum, but tickets were sold out until after dinnertime. So we moved on down the street to the Japanese Tea Garden. We made it in just before close: long enough to walk around and snap some photos, but not long enough to sit down for a cup of tea. Next trip we will need to plan a bit better and see much more of the beautiful sights San Francisco has to offer.
