Last year I started a list of 26 things I wanted to complete before my 26th birthday. I thought if I had a finite list of things, I’d be motivated to cross the items off one by one. In the middle few months, life and work got crazy and I lost focus. However, I still was able to complete items I certainly wouldn’t have otherwise. With my 26th birthday come and gone, here’s a retrospective on my progress and how I plan to continue with my venture.

## Things I completed:

**Took a weekend trip to Sedona** -- [link](/2010/11/29/sedona/)  
**Read and returned all borrowed books** -- [link](http://myfantasticlife.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/books.jpg)  
**Got a record player** -- [link](/2010/08/23/crosley-portable-record-player/)  
**Saw Fountains of Wayne in concert** -- [link](/2010/10/02/fountains-of-wayne/)  
**Reconnected with an old friend** -- [link](/2011/04/08/friends-again/)  
**Replaced master bathroom shower** -- [link](/2011/04/02/shiny-new-shower/)  
**Watched The Godfather** -- [link](/2010/09/22/the-godfather/)  
**Organized the garage** -- [link](/2011/04/12/garage-organization/)  
**Digitally organized and archived all photos** -- [link](/2011/04/04/digital-archiving/)  
**Lost 15 pounds** -- [link](/2011/03/28/feeling-healthy/)  
**Learned to properly cook a steak** -- [link](/2010/09/20/cooking-steaks/)  
**Created wedding books for my parents and in-laws** -- [link](/2010/09/11/wedding-books/)

## Things in progress:

**Replace guest bathtub** -- Materials purchased and ready to be installed in May.  
**Host a poker night** -- Poker chips and table are ready, interest has been shown, date to be set soon.  
**Reduce my private debt by one fourth** -- I’ve set up a timeline and payment plan and have already made my first payment. I should be debt-free in a couple years.  
**Refresh and customize an old piece of furniture** -- I have the piece already, but have been agonizing over what paint color to use.

## Things I still plan on completing:

**Paint the kitchen cabinets** -- Just waiting for a long weekend so I can do it all at once. I may try the bathroom cabinets first as a test run.  
**Have a smores party** -- We plan to put in some grass, a fire pit, and a nice seating area in the backyard. Then, smores for everyone.  
**Paint a picture for myself** -- I have a few commissions lined up, but will soon after begin painting more for myself.  
**Learn how to change a tire** -- Someday...  
**Take a city tour of Phoenix** -- Of all the tours I researched, the Town Lake segway tour sounds the most fun. May have to wait till fall for the best weather.  

## Things I don’t plan on completing:

**Build a piece of furniture** -- Too many tools to buy and too much work. I’d much rather spend time browsing antique stores!  
**Try snowboarding again** -- Last time I was in snowy climate, I found every excuse not to go snowboarding. Too expensive, too scary, and too much prep. I’ll stick to wakeboarding and warm weather.  
**Take a pottery class** -- My dad and I are going to take a printmaking class instead. Fun!  
**Stay up all night and watch the sun rise** -- I’m just too old for this, ha!  
**Buy a nice set of dishes and flatware** -- I actually shopped around for these, priced everything, and then decided I’d rather spend my money on other things. Our IKEA plates and Target flatware are good enough for us.

While I didn’t complete most of my list, I still feel great about it. One of my resolutions this year was to complete more projects I start. I loved the process and now am considering some larger, more difficult items for my 30 before 30 list.
