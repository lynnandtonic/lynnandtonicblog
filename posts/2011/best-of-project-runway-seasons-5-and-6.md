Here are my favorite looks from Project Runway’s seasons 5 and 6. I loved season 5 for Leanne’s structural and whimsical clothes and Kenley’s 40s flair and horrible personality. Season 6 was probably my least favorite season and I wasn’t thrilled with the move from New York to Los Angeles. I thought the talent wasn’t as great and the personalities weren’t as fun.
