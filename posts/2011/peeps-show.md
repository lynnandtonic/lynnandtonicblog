I love me some Easter. One of my favorite things is the Washington Post's annual Peeps diorama contest. Not only do I love the soft, sugary taste of Peeps, I especially love miniatures and dioramas. I'm always amazed at the creative and fun scenes people come up with. While none this year were quite as good as last year's _Up_ diorama (seen [here](/2010/04/04/happy-easter/)), these ones are still pretty sweet. Happy Easter weekend everyone!
