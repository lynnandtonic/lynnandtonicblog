I absolutely love this blog. [Awesome People Hanging Out Together](http://awesomepeoplehangingouttogether.tumblr.com/) posts photographs of exactly that. My favorites are the unlikely groupings of celebrities and historic icons, making them seem so much more human and real. Better yet, most of the photos feel natural and fun; itâ€™s a neat way to view these people we recognize and love.
