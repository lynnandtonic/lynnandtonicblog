Fountains of Wayne’s new album _Sky Full of Holes_ is finally being released this Tuesday. It’s currently streaming on Facebook and, after only one listen, I’m in love. They’re playing in L.A. in October and we’re already planning a trip. Hopefully they’ll book a Phoenix date, but in the meantime I’ll just listen to this song over and over.
