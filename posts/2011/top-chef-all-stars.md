For the finale of this season’s _Top Chef_, they are having five chefs competing for the title. The lineup for this “all star” season was pretty impressive, but most of my all-time favorites were left missing. If I were to pick the five best chefs who didn’t win, from all the seasons, the group would look a lot different.

I would have picked: **Kevin Gillespie** - ginger beardie with lovable personality and comfort food awesomeness, **Richard Blais** - the wizard with the faux hawk and liquid nitrogen tank, **Sam Talbot** - tall and handsome with love for sweet and savory combinations, **Bryan Voltaggio** - the nicer and more professional of the brothers, **Stefan Richter** - everyone’s favorite carefree Euro. Now _that_ would be a competition!
