Just a few of my favorite things combined into one adorable accessory: Diana Eng’s whimsical design, Asian inspired fashion, and things that look like food, but aren’t. I love these [coin purses](http://www.dianaeng.com/shop/fortune-cookie-coin-purse/) by the _Project Runawy_ alum. They are made from recycled leather and each one is unique. They also include a printed fortune inside. While $65 is a little steep for a coin purse, I still can’t help but swoon.
