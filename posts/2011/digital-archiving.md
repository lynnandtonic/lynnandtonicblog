With only eight days until my birthday, I’m making a mad dash to complete items on my [26 before 26](/2010/08/22/26-before-26/) list. I’ve been working on this one for a while and finally completed it: #20: <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Digitally organize and archive all photos</span>.

I took this opportunity to not only organize my photos, but all my documents and media. I picked up a [LaCie 1 terabyte external hard drive](http://www.lacie.com/products/product.htm?id=10177) and started filling it up. All my artwork, schoolwork, music, and movies were easy to transfer from various storage systems and now are all organized in one place. My photos were a different story. I had boxes and boxes of prints, CDs, memory cards, and negatives to sort through. Luckily, Target took care of most of it for me. I dropped off bags of prints and negatives and picked up some neatly stacked photo CDs. I now have digital copies of all my photos and even found some pretty good ones from the past (see below).
