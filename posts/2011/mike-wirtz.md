While studying fine art at ASU, I was repeatedly in awe of many of the graduate students. Their talent was so impressive and the dedication to their craft was an excellent example for us budding artists. One painter I admired was [Mike Wirtz](http://homepage.mac.com/mikewirtz/index.htm), who won me over with his large scale portraiture. He hasnâ€™t added much work to his portfolio recently, but I check back every now and then to appreciate his pieces.
