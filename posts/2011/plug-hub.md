Even if you aren’t an organizing junkie, this product is bound to make you swoon. Cable clutter is a constant struggle for me, especially since Clay has _three_ PC’s and a television on his desk. Currently we have an embarrassing jumble of cables gathered by two IKEA [Signum cable organizers](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/50035115). The [Plug Hub](http://www.quirky.com/products/64-Plug-Hub-Desk-Power-Cable-Organizer) is a minimalist, unobtrusive cable organizer that hides the clutter while keeping plugs accessible. It’s only available for pre-order right now, to be pushed into production if enough people show interest. At only $23.95, I sure hope all the organizers out there are just as excited as I am.
