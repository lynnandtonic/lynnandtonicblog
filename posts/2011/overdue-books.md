This item on my [26 before 26](/2010/08/22/26-before-26/) list was difficult for me. I technically only completed half of it, but I’m still crossing off #4: <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Read and return all borrowed books</span>.

For the past year, I’ve discovered my inability to read books. Don’t get me wrong, I _love_ reading. I used to read a book a week and couldn’t get enough. Lately though, with work, family, and house, I just can’t seem to focus long enough to get through a decent number of pages. I read a chapter, but can’t remember most of it. My mind is a wanderer. So as I work towards getting my reading groove back, I decided to return any borrowed books from friends and family anyway.

I was surprised to feel a weight lifted. The pile of borrowed books on my to-do list was always in the back of my mind and it was a relief to clear them from my space. I’ve resolved to first read any books I own that I have yet to enjoy and, in the future, to only borrow one book at a time.
