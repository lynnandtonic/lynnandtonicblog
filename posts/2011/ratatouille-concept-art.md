After my trip to Disneyland this past weekend, I’ve been looking for some inspirational and beautiful concept artwork for our house. I stumbled upon some shots from Pixar’s book [_The Art of Ratatouille_](http://www.amazon.com/Art-Ratatouille-Karen-Paik/dp/0811858340) and they are amazing. Until I can find some prints, I’m putting this book on my immediate wish list. _Ratatouille_ is one of my very favorite films, combining my loves for Paris, food, and Pixar’s magic.
