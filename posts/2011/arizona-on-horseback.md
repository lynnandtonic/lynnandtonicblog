This Thanksgiving my mother-in-law planned an afternoon trail ride for us. We spent two hours in Cave Creek riding through the chilly desert landscape. Itâ€™d been years since the last time I was on a horse, but it came right back. It was so fun and an amazing way to appreciate the beautiful outdoors here in Phoenix.
