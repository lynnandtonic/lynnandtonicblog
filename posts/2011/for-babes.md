Recently, two of our couple friends each found themselves expecting baby boys. So, naturally, I searched around for some fun and geeky onesies to give as gifts. I’m a little scared of babies, but not if they were wearing these! Not sure when Clay and I are going to have kids, but you can be sure we’ll be getting plenty of nerd-wear.
