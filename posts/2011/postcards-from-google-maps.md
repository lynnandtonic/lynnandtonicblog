I saw these on [Apartment Therapy](http://apartmenttherapy.com) and was in awe. Artist Clement Valla takes images from Google Maps that, when viewed at the right angle, transform landscapes into warped and surreal representations. Valla says:

_The images are screenshots from Google Earth with basic color adjustments and cropping. I am collecting these new typologies as a means of conservation--as Google Earth improves its 3D models, its terrain, and its satellite imagery, these strange, surrealist depictions of our built environment and its relation to the natural landscape will disappear in favor of better illusionistic imagery. However, I think these strange mappings of the 2-dimensional and the 3-dimensional provide us with fabulous forms that are purely the result of algorithmic processes and not of human aesthetic decision making. They are artifacts worth preserving._
