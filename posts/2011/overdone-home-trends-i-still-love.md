As often as I can, I like to browse home decor magazines and blogs for inspiration and stress relief. I love to see what new home trends will pop up and how I can incorporate fun and interesting ideas into our little Chandler house. As blog commenters will no doubt tell you, many home trends become so ubiquitous, the sight of them annoys even the calmest of us all. However, these handful of overdone home trends, I just can’t get enough. Anytime I see them pop up on blogs or on the pages of my favorite magazines, I swoon. Sometimes you just have to do what you like, even if everyone else is doing the same thing.

**Chalkboard walls:** Yup, still love ’em. They incorporate both functionality and whimsy, reminding me always of the dusty smell of old school classrooms. None of that white board marker smell in here. They are especially beautiful in unexpected places and when the home owner has particularly good handwriting or drawing skills.

**Wall decals:** The perfect solution for renters or the commitment-phobe. I’ll be the first to admit I have an obsessive problem committing to home decor. I agonize over paint choices, furniture sizes, and the right depth of bookcase. Wall decals allow us to add some life to our space, without the scary permanence.

**White ceramic animals:** As a kid I collected animal figurines of all shapes and sizes. I adored dogs, wolves, and horses and had a full ceramic menagerie. Later I discovered that was, well, kind of lame. Enter the white ceramic animal trend. Now I can air my ceramic animal love out in the open, while appearing hip and contemporary. What a glorious day.

**Keep Calm and Carry On prints:** These are _everywhere_. But you know, it’s still as charming as the first time I saw it. Clear and concise with no extra fluff, it’s a message we should all keep in mind on a daily basis.

**Brightly colored accent walls:** Scared of choosing a non-neutral for you house? Simple solution: pick a bright color and pick a wall. It’s an easy way create focus in a room and bring that room to life. Change your mind later on? Luckily, you only have one wall to re-paint.

**Faux taxidermy:** I’m the first to freak out in a room of death (for all you Ace Ventura fans out there) and I cry at the thought of shooting an animal for a trophy. I do, however, love the trend of faux animal heads. Cardboard, paper-mâché, I don’t care. All I know is having a _fake_ animal on your wall doesn’t bother me one bit.
