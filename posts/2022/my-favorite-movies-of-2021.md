Another weird year in the books. Going to the cinema was a strategic endeavor of finding unpopular showtimes and empty theaters, but I was still able to catch a bunch of new films. Here are my favorites I saw this year.

Honorable mentions to _Last Night in Soho_ and _The Eyes of Tammy Faye_ which were both well made and well acted, but left me feeling not good! (Also I couldn’t decide, so it’s a list of 11.)
