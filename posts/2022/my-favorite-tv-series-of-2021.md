I didn’t catch as many new shows as I would have liked this year (honestly, how can anyone keep up). I did enjoy watching some shows I missed the first time around like _Broad City_, _Superstore_, _Nailed It!_, and _Manifest_. And I must call out season 2 of _Ted Lasso_ and the episode _Beard After Hours_ which I loved so so much.

This list is my favorite TV series or miniseries that debuted in 2021 (plus one comedy special). This criteria is interesting since a lot of my all-time favorite shows don’t really figure themselves out until season 2 or later. So should be fun to revisit this in a few years.
