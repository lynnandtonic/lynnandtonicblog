I’m happy to cross off the first item on my [30 Before 30](/2012/04/13/30-before-30/) list I created in April, #22: <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Re-read the U.S. Constitution</span>.

Every day I am thankful to be living and working in the United States. I wasn’t born here, but I don’t ever question belonging in this great nation. I’ve been meaning to learn more about American history, and what better place to begin than the U.S. Constitution? While the language can be a little dry, the document is really incredible and inspiring. The Preamble is my absolute favorite part. If a more clear and important mission statement was ever written, I don’t know what it is.

_We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America._

I’ve posted this video before, but it’s one I love. Penn and Teller can describe it like no others.
