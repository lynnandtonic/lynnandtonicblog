Today I had a fun conversation with some friends about the film _Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter_ and the upcoming biopic _Lincoln_ starring the amazing Daniel Day Lewis. While the two films have different plots (one true to history and one not so much), it can still be confusing as to which one is which. This isn’t the first time two strikingly similar movies have been made and released suspiciously close together. Here are a few you may also have confused.

**Year: 2009, Released: 9 weeks apart**  
Two films about the dangerous lives of mall security guards featuring pretty funny lead actors. While I do love Anna Faris, I think I love Kevin James on a Segway a little bit more.  
**Winner:** _Paul Blart: Mall Cop_

![The Prestige, The Illusionist](/img/doublefeature2.jpg)

**Year: 2006, Released: 8 weeks apart**  
Two dark films about magicians. Both of these movies were actually pretty good, which isn’t surprising when Edward Norton and Christian Bale are involved. However, I just can’t seem to take Paul Giamatti seriously, in any role ever.  
**Winner:** _The Prestige_

![No Strings Attached, Friends with Benefits](/img/doublefeature3.jpg)

**Year: 2011, Released: 6 months apart**  
Two films about casual sex between friends. What could possibly go wrong with a friends with benefits situation? Especially when you’re gorgeous like Mila Kunis, Justin Timberlake, Natalie Portman, and Ashton Kutcher.  
**Winner:** _Friends with Benefits_

![Deep Impact, Armageddon](/img/doublefeature5.jpg)

**Year: 1998, Released: 7 weeks apart**  
Two films about an asteroid about to hit Earth and destroy all of humanity. I love an epic disaster movie and these two are no exception. Morgan Freeman is definitely the better President, but the cheese factor in _Armageddon_ is just too good to resist.  
**Winner:** _Armageddon_

![Antz, A Bug’s Life](/img/doublefeature6.jpg)

**Year: 1998, Released: 7 weeks apart**  
Two computer animated films about ants. And so it begins: where all other animation studios desperately try to outmatch Pixar. In only the rarest occasion do they succeed and this was not one of them.  
**Winner:** _A Bug’s Life_

![Chasing Liberty, First Daughter](/img/doublefeature7.jpg)

**Year: 2004, Released: 8 months apart**  
Two films about the President’s daughter just wanting to have a normal life. If you know me at all, you certainly know about my undying love for the beautiful Mandy Moore and every romantic comedy she’s ever made.  
**Winner:** _Chasing Liberty_

![Mirror Mirror, Snow White and the Huntsman](/img/doublefeature4.jpg)

**Year: 2012, Released: 8 weeks apart**  
Two films about Snow White. I haven’t seen either of these films, but there’s only one I’m excited about. Time will tell on which one is more successful, but I already have my prediction.  
**Winner:** _Snow White and the Huntsman_
