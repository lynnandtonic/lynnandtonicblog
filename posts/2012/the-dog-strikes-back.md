Volkswagen released a follow-up commercial to its awesome miniature Darth Vader one from last year ([see here](/2011/10/06/the-force-volkswagen-commercial/)). While this one isnâ€™t quite as charming, it does feature a cute dog and a _Star Wars_ cantina scene at the end. And truthfully, what more do you need?
