Instagram is huge right now. My sister-in-law, Vanessa has been chronicling baby Henry’s life with the app and the pictures are awesome. For her birthday this year, I decided to try out [ImageSnap](https://www.imagesnap.com/). They take your Instagram (or any) photos and print them on ceramic tiles. The teeny tiles are 2" by 2" and are the perfect size for fridge magnets. They turned out really great and I’ll definitely be ordering more real soon.
