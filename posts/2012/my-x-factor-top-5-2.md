Last season about this time I posted my [top 5 X-Factor picks](/2011/10/25/my-x-factor-top-5/). Chris Rene and Josh Krajcik made it to the very end, but lost to Melanie Amaro. This season, I’m putting all my money on Carly Rose Sonenclar. However, I’d still be ok with any of these other 4 making it to the end with her.
