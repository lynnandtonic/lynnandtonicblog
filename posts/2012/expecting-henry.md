My brother and sister-in-law took some fun pregnancy photos this weekend with their friend and photographer Angela Dimler. They are quite the photogenic pair and the photos turned out great! I’m very excited to meet little Henry, who is due on Pi Day (3-14): a little nerd in the making. Here are a few of my favorites, and you can view the rest at [Angela’s blog](http://www.millionsofmasonjars.blogspot.com/2012/02/vanessa-and-steve-and-henry.html).
