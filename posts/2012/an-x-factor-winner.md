I was going to wait until the live shows to declare my favorite singers on this season of _The X Factor_, but let’s be real. The only name anyone needs to know is Carly Rose Sonenclar. She’s 13, insanely talented, and thankfully, not annoying. She’s going to win it all. And if she doesn’t I’ll be more upset than when Kevin didn’t win _Top Chef Las Vegas_. And that was the worst!
