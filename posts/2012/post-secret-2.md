Every Sunday I look at the new batch of [Post Secrets](http://postsecret.com). While many of them can be deeply moving, scary, or depressing, some of my favorites are still the light-hearted ones. The confessions that might get you teased socially, but aren’t truly secrets. I saw this one this morning and laughed; I just can’t help but relate.

Now all I need to see is an “I love Nicolas Cage movies” post secret and I’ll know I’m truly not alone.
