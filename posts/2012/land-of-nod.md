Way back in 2010, I posted [Kid Stuff for Adults](/2010/05/31/kid-stuff-for-adults/) showcasing some neat home items from Crate and Barrel’s online kids store, Land of Nod.

They’ve really stepped up their game, offering beautiful and functional pieces for children. Some of their products are so stylish they could easily fit into an adult’s home as well. Here are a few of my favorites.
