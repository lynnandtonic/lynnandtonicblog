Clay and I saw _Ted_ yesterday and, although I had little to no expectations, it was much better than I thought it would be. My biggest worry was that it would be a really long _Family Guy_ episode, but it had a decent plot and pretty good character development. Some parts were definitely hilarious and others a little too forced. The best thing this movie accomplishes is showing me I can enjoy a Mark Wahlberg movie. (Ok, ok, I did like _the Italian Job_ but I don’t think anyone’s claiming that’s a masterpiece of cinema.)

For fans of _Family Guy_, it will be difficult to separate Ted from Peter Griffin, and even harder to feel normal about Lori sounding so much like Meg. Giovanni Ribisi steals every scene he’s in, and a cameo by Ryan Reynolds will make you giggle. All in all, it’s a fun little film, but nothing to write home about.
