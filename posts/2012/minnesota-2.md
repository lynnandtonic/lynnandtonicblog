Clay and I just got home after spending 5 days with his family in Minneapolis and Moose Lake, Minnesota. Fisher family visits always consist of great food, plenty of laughing, and loud, late-night games. This trip was no exception.

The weather was a nice break from the Arizona desert. We took full advantage by renting bicycles at Minnehaha Falls, pontooning on Sand Lake, tubing down the Cannon River Valley, and watching the Twins play at Target Field. We also took a little trip to look at some adorable shih tzu, poodle mix puppies. It was plenty difficult to not take one home.

We had a blast, but it’s great to be home in mosquito-free Phoenix with the pups.
