My living room is fairly small and seating is limited. It also serves double-duty as Clay’s exercise area. With that comes plenty of clutter: video game controllers, weights, yoga mats, etc. To solve a couple problems, we’re looking for an upholstered storage bench. Not only will it add additional seating, but serve to hide away many of the things we wish to keep in the space. I love all of these storage benches and now it’s time to make a decision!
