All I’ve been watching are singing competition shows. _The Voice_ keeps growing on me and this season there are a handful of really unique and talented singers. These are my five favorites. I love Melanie Martinez; she’s so different and reminds me of a cartoon character. I’ve already bought songs from all five of them and I hope they all make it really far!
