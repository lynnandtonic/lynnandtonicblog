With my efforts to paint more frequently and at smaller scale, I came up with the idea to make painted versions of people’s Instagram photos. We are capturing more and more with this fun little app, and the square format and recognizable filters make for equally fun little paintings. For my friend Kate’s birthday, I decided to to paint her a 6" x 6" of her Instagram pic of her family’s farm. I think it turned out pretty neat and I can’t wait to paint more of them!
