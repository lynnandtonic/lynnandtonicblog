With another season of _Project Runway_ wrapped up, here are my favorite looks from seasons 9 and 10. I loved both of these seasons, especially the drama. In season 9, Anya was the clear favorite, while Bert and Becky competed for most annoying. With season 10, I loved Christopher and Gunnar, but hated Ven’s monotone voice and bad attitude in the makeover challenge. All I can say is that I can’t wait for the next season to start.

You may also want to see my favorite looks from: [Seasons 1 and 2](/2011/01/31/best-of-project-runway-seasons-1-and-2/), [Seasons 3 and 4](/2011/02/07/best-of-project-runway-seasons-3-and-4/), [Seasons 5 and 6](/2011/02/13/best-of-project-runway-seasons-5-and-6/), and [Seasons 7 and 8](/2011/03/03/best-of-project-runway-seasons-7-and-8/).
