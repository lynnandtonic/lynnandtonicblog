Reuters photographer David Gray has captured the partially-built and abandoned amusement park Wonderland in Chenzhuang Village, China, just outside of Beijing. While investors hoped it would become the biggest amusement park in the East, funding ran out and the 100-acre development was left behind. These photos are incredibly haunting.
