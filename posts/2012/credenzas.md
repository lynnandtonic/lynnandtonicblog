Another decor decision to make! Currently in our living room, we have a simple vintage dresser I found for about $20 and repainted. I’d like to move that dresser into our guest room, so we’re in need of some living room/dining room storage. I love the clean lines and concealed storage of these credenzas. With the AZ dust, closed storage is a must. I’m favoring the Dumont Buffet from West Elm, but it’s also the most expensive. Decisions decisions!
