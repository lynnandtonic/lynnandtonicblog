I love Disney and I love Annie Leibovitz’s _Disney Dream_ portraits featuring celebrities as iconic Disney characters. Her newest portraits feature Russell Brand as Captain Hook and Will Ferrell, Jason Segel, and Jack Black as the Hitchhiking Ghosts from Disneyland’s the Haunted Mansion. Perfect additions to the already amazing series. Check them out, with a few of my earlier favorites:
