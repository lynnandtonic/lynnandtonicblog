Over at [Yellow Brick Home](http://www.yellowbrickhome.com/2012/04/09/thrift-paint/), I fell in love with the liquid gold leaf treatment they gave their dog bust. I knew it was something I definitely wanted to try.

I decided to use the same [Plaid Liquid Leaf](http://www.amazon.com/Plaid-6110-Liquid-Leaf-oz-Classic/dp/B000BZX2GS) that they recommended. The next decision was what to paint. A few years ago I found these two figures at a thrift store for next to nothing and spray painted them white. I never did love the way they looked and so I chose them to be the guinea pigs.

For prep, I simply rinsed and dried them to get rid of any dust. I thought of priming, but then took the lazy route. I used a small paintbrush I had laying around and remembered to shake the bottle every few minutes.

After two coats, I think they turned out pretty great. Now Iâ€™m looking all over the house for other things to gold leaf.
