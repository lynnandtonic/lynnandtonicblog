I hope everyone goes and sees _Wreck-It Ralph_ as soon as humanly possible. It’s seriously AMAZING. It’s the best of what an animated film should be: nostalgic, fun, sad at parts, funny at others, and tied together by brilliant voice performance and visual effects. Although it’s not a Pixar film, it’s definitely at that level of quality. Truthfully, I think I prefer it to most of the Pixar films. Every geek should see it, just for the video game references. And every person should see it, just because it’s awesome.
