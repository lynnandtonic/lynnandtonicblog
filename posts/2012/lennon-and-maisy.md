Yesterday my friend [Kate Farrar](http://blog.katefarrar.com/) showed me this video of sisters Lennon and Maisy Stella. They are 12 and 8 years old, respectively, and are crazy talented. I’d never heard this song before (neither Robyn nor Erato’s versions), but I’m definitely into it. And I’m not exaggerating when I say I **_can not_** stop watching it.
