To celebrate Clay’s 30th birthday and the coming of the new year, we met Clay’s family out in San Diego. His brothers have been living there for the past few years and we are so happy to have finally made it out there to see them. While spending time with his family guarantees an abundance of delicious food, we also made sure to have several activities on the calendar this year.

We all stayed in a vacation rental in La Jolla with plenty of vintage charm. We especially had fun with the croquet set in the backyard.

On Saturday we went for a hike in Torrey Pines. The weather was absolutely perfect. While we didn’t make it into the ocean, we did get to feel plenty of ocean breeze.

Later that day, we headed to Point Loma to take some family photos. The fog was so thick we could barely see in front of us as we drove. Even though the weather wasn’t great, I’m sure the photos will be.

On Sunday we took a brunch cruise around San Diego Bay. We enjoyed tasty treats, champagne, and the beautiful shorelines of San Diego and Coronado Island. Two of my favorite sights were some sea lions lounging and the California, a Dutch clipper that gives tours of the Bay.

The trip was so much fun and it was great to see Clay’s family again. We all agreed San Diego was much better than Tahoe, where we spent New Year’s Eve last year. The weather was much nicer and the activities easier to get to. We’ll definitely have to make it out there this summer so we can hit the beach.
