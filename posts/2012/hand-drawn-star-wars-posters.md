Loving these hand-drawn _Star Wars_ posters by [Christopher Lee](http://www.thebeastisback.com/). He captures the key characters and scenes from each film in charming illustration. While _Return of the Jedi_ is my favorite of the three, I think the original film’s poster is my favorite. And at only $35 each, it won’t break the bank to order all of them.
