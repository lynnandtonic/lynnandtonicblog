After several years of waiting, I finally saw the first installment of _The Hobbit_. Even with all the anticipation and the anxiety about the story being broken up into three films, it was truly excellent. The magic and fun of the story are easily captured and the epic scale of the original trilogy is well maintained.

Especially wonderful is the opening scene, showing an interaction between Bilbo and Frodo just moments before _The Fellowship of the Ring_ begins. It’s a perfect nod to the trilogy we all love and shows how this new series of films will fit right in. And the very best part is the magnificent Martin Freeman, portraying the simple, yet courageous Bilbo as we always imagined.
