I don’t talk much about my job on here, but most days I spend my time with [meltmedia](http://meltmedia.com), designing sites and applications for the web. My most recent project has been a refresh of our corporate website. It was a particularly fun, but quick project where I was able to design, develop, and write the site’s content.

Check out my post on meltmedia’s blog that details what we changed and why we changed it: [A meltmedia.com Refresh](http://blog.meltmedia.com/2012/07/a-meltmedia-com-refresh/). And check out the full [meltmedia.com](http://meltmedia.com) and tell me what you think!
