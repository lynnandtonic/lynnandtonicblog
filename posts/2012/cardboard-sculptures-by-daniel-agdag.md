Um, seriously? These cardboard sculptures by [Daniel Agdag](http://www.publicoffice.com.au/Home.html) are unbelievable! Tiny and intricate details, hauntingly lit, and mesmerizing to look at. I am so impressed. I especially love the shots of the artist working; it really puts the delicacy of the work into perspective.
