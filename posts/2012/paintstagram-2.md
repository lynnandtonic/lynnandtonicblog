After my first [Paintstagram attempt](/2012/06/16/paintstagram/), I decided to try again for my boss and friend, Dave Woodruff. His birthday was last month, and after weeks of procrastination, I finally finished his Paintstagram. It’s a 6" x 6" of an Instagram he took on the New York subway.

And, here’s the Instagram Dave took of the painting of the Instagram. Inceptiongram, as some people say.
