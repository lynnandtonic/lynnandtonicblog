I finally saw _Moonrise Kingdom_ this week. I’ve noticed I tend to procrastinate in seeing Wes Anderson’s latest films. Expectations are so high, I worry about disappointment. But, _Moonrise Kingdom_ is so sweet, you’d have to be heartless not to love it. The scenes are beautiful and whimsical as Anderson always delivers, and Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward as Sam and Suzy are awkward perfection. While this film doesn’t have the weight of a _Life Aquatic_ or the smarts of a _Royal Tenenbaums_, it captures a charming innocence we can’t ignore.
