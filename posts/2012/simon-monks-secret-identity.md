Painter [Simon Monk](http://simonmonk.com/index.php?/ongoing/secret-identity/) has created a masterful series titled _Secret Identity_. The series depicts photorealistic superhero action figures in plastic bags. My particular favorite is _Clark Kent_. I can only exist in awe of his talent. Absolutely beautiful.
