I never thought I’d finish this one, but I’m thrilled to cross off another item on my [30 Before 30](/2012/04/13/30-before-30/) list, #25: <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Organize my email inbox</span>.

In my offline life, I’m pretty organized. I’m the opposite of a hoarder, always trying to find things to get rid of and spaces to declutter. For whatever reason, I can’t seem to carry that mentality over to my email inbox. At the beginning of this effort, I had thousands of random email messages from several years, not categorized or labeled in any way. I just needed to sit down and power through it.

So, after a few hours of deleting, folder organization, and laughing at silly emails from years past, I am excited to see this message for the first time ever:

![There are no emails in your Inbox folder](/img/inboxzero.png)

Now my new goal is to keep it this way forever and not let my email hoarding tendency come back!
