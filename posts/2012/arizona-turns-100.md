Along with Valentine’s Day, today is Arizona’s 100th birthday. On Feb. 14th, 1912, Arizona received its statehood. While our great state has been getting a lot of negative press lately, I can confidently say that living here is absolutely wonderful. I’ve lived in the Phoenix area for almost 25 years and I’ve never questioned it.

The heat (and yes, it’s a dry heat) is comforting for me; summertime is my favorite time of year. The desert landscapes are beautiful and the sunsets are unbelievable. The art and design communities are blossoming, we have unique and tasty restaurants, and the broad range of terrain is surprising for many. Just two hours from the desert valley of Phoenix is the snowy mountain town of Flagstaff. I’ve traveled a lot in my short life and no place (even Paris) has felt quite as nice as Arizona. Plus, we have the Grand Canyon, Steve Nash, and plenty of scorpion lollipops.

Happy birthday, Arizona. Here’s to another 100.
