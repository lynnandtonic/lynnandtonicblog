For my birthday this year, my in-laws generously gifted me with a Silhouette CAMEO electronic cutting tool. I’ve been wishing for one for a long time and I’m super excited to start cutting all the things!

For my first project, I decided to start small. We had some large plastic bottles lying around, so I thought some custom labels would be fun. I threw together some quick labels in their editor, which was pretty easy to use for simple designs.

After the CAMEO cut the self-stick vinyl, I transferred the vinyl to the transfer paper and then transferred them to the bottles.

The labels didn’t adhere as quickly as I’d hoped, but after some time, it’s looking good. I’m not sure how the steam of the shower will affect the labels, but for now, I’m super happy!
