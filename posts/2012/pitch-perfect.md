This weekend I saw the _Pitch Perfect_ trailer for the first time. I think I may have audibly squealed in the movie theatre. A movie about battling a capella groups featuring the charming Anna Kendrick? It’s like the movie gods are answering my prayers. But seriously, I love a good sing-off. _Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit_ and _Glee_ are two of my favorites and I can’t wait to add this one to the list!
