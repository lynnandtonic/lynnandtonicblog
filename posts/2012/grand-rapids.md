This last weekend I traveled with a few of my friends and coworkers to Grand Rapids, Michigan for a design conference. We were all surprised and excited to find that downtown Grand Rapids is actually pretty cool. We stayed just a few feet away from the BOB, a historic building turned into a group of restaurants and bars. We also ate at Stella’s, a bar that features classic arcade games and one of the best burgers I’ve ever had. And to top it all off, the weather was a perfect non-humid 80 degrees. While I don’t anticipate visiting again anytime soon, I can confidently say it was a fun place to spend a few days.
