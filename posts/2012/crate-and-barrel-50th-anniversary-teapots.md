I’m in love with these [50th Anniversary Teapots from Crate and Barrel](http://www.crateandbarrel.com/shop-by-idea/50th-anniversary-teapots/1?st=50th%20and%20forever&rc=110). Starting in December, each month will feature a custom-designed, limited-edition teapot. With only 200 of each design available, I’m sure these will be in high demand.
