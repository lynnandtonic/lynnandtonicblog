As 2012 has started, I’ve been thinking a lot about resolutions. While I’m sure most everyone has some variation of “lose weight” on their list of things to accomplish this year, I thought it best to set some realistic goals for myself. As a lover of all types of junk food, I tend to go to extremes when dieting. Last year I did a twelve week nutrition plan where I cut out all carbs and sugars from my diet. After I began eating normally, I started feeling sluggish and I began to gain weight again. This year, I’m setting four small resolutions with the goal of feeling better, having more energy, and being more healthy.

**1\. Drink more water.**  
I’m a compulsive diet soda drinker. When I get stressed it’s even worse. I will drink more water during the day and order water at restaurants when I go out. As an added bonus, I’ll save the $2.50 I spend each time.

**2\. Replace soda with tea.**  
Even though I’m culturally Chinese and I grew up with parents who love tea, I never found a taste for it. I will stop drinking soda and replace my flavored drink cravings with tea, hot or iced. Not only will I benefit from the health-boosting aspects of tea, I’ll also be able to use the Tour Eiffel teapot and monogrammed mug I received for Christmas.

**3\. Take the stairs.**  
Finding a good exercise routine will be a challenge. Clay and I have talked about hiking, biking, and even running (yuck). When I’m not in exercise mode though, I will no longer go out of my way to be lazy. I will take the stairs instead of the escalator and walk across the parking lot instead of desperately trying to find a closer spot.

**4\. Feel healthier this Christmas than I did the last.**  
It’s easy to set resolutions and to get going on them. Clay and I have already bought healthy groceries and picked out some green teas to try. In a few months, I could easily be back to my old ways again. I will remember all year how I feel today and I will feel great this December too.
