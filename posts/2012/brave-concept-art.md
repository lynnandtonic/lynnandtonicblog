Yesterday we saw Pixar’s new animated film _Brave_, the story of a frizzy-haired Scottish princess who wants to avoid betrothal and determine her own fate. While it definitely is a departure from Pixar’s signature whimsy, it feels genuine and classic like a throwback to the Disney animated films of the past. It is funny, emotional, and beautifully animated. And on top of that, it’s the first of Pixar’s films dedicated to a female lead character. Merida, with her red curls and awesome bow skills, is a great addition to the family of Disney princesses.

When I saw this small collection of _Brave_ concept art, I knew the film was at least going to be amazing to look at. But, as Pixar has proven time and time again, we can always expect beautiful visuals and a beautiful story.
