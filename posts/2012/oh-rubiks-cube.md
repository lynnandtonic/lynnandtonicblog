Crossing off another item on my [30 Before 30](/2012/04/13/30-before-30/) list, #20: <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Learn to solve a Rubik’s cube</span>.

Until recently I’d never even tried to solve a Rubik’s Cube. It kind of scared me and, after looking at one, didn’t make a whole lot of sense. I wish I could say I’m one of those people that could just see one and instantly understand how to solve it. Even when following directions, I had some trouble. But, after about two weeks of _constantly_ working at it, I can consistently (and excitedly) solve a Rubik’s cube every time I try.

For those also not naturally Rubik’s Cube gifted, here is the tutorial I used: [How to Solve a Rubik’s Cube](http://www.wikihow.com/Solve-a-Rubik's-Cube-(Easy-Move-Notation)). It had the easiest notation and was the simplest to follow.

To prove I could actually do this, I thought about putting up a video of me completing the Cube. But since it takes me an average of 3 minutes, I figured it might be a bit boring. So instead, here’s a video of the world record at 5.66 seconds.
