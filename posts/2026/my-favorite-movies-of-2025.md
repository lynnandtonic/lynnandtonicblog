I watched 124 movies from 2025 and still feel like there’s so many I missed. It was a good year at the cinema!

Found it hard to narrow this list down, so some very honorable mentions are *Bugonia*, *The Long Walk*, *Roofman*, *Elio*, *The Wedding Banquet*, *Eternity*, and of course *Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning*.

I also was very intrigued and horrified by the two Titan sub disaster documentaries (HBO and Netflix each have one) and I absolutely loved the “Rock DJ” sequence from *Better Man* which was one of the best things I saw all year (technically released late 2024).

Many of these are instant classics, in my opinion! Here are my faves from 2025.
