A decent year of TV! Again I tried to prioritize 2025 debuts, so I still have some catching up to do with follow-up seasons of previous faves (especially second seasons of *A Man on the Inside* and *Nobody Wants This*).

I did really enjoy the much anticipated season 2 of *Severance*, the final season of my favorite platonic love story, *Mythic Quest*, and the latest (final?) season of *Poker Face*. I also watched season 1 of *Ludwig* (2024) which was excellent and surely would have made my list last year had I timed things better.

2025 had a few standouts for me and the rest were pretty solid. I actually had a tough time deciding on #10 here, so some honorable mentions are *Murderbot*, *Apple Cider Vinegar*, *Smoke*, *Stick* (which really surprised me), and the upsetting, but well-made *Adolescence*.

Here are my fave miniseries and series debuts from 2025.
