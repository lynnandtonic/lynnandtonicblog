The second Apple store in Paris opened earlier this month, and I can’t help but swoon. The distinctly sleek brand took over a distinctly Parisian former bank building directly facing the Opéra national de Paris. I’m so glad they kept the original architecture; it is charming and definitely makes an impact. Just another reason to love the city of light.
