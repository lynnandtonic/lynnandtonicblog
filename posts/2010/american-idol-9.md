For many, and me especially, _American Idol_ is more of a guilty pleasure than a means to find new music. Although I love the show and become invested in the contestants, it’s pretty rare that I will purchase the album of the winner or runners-up. The show realized this and now the judges are really stressing that the winner know what kind of “artist” he or she wants to be. We all know it’s fun to vote for the goofy underdog, but no one wants to follow him after the show ends. (Sorry, Taylor Hicks)

With that said, my criteria for picking the winner has changed. My favorite was kicked out super early (Alex Lambert), so I’ve been waiting to get hooked by someone else. With 6 contestants left, my pick for the winner is Lee Dewyze. I’m excited to see what happens!
