From [mymodernmet.com](http://www.mymodernmet.com/profiles/blogs/van-goghs-paintings-get):  
_After seeing how tilt-shift photography could make real world scenes appear like miniature models, Serena Malyon, a third-year art student, decided to simulate the effect on Van Goghâ€™s famous paintings. Using Photoshop, she manipulated the light and adjusted the focus to make us see these paintings in ways we could have never imagined._

All I have to say is UH-MAZING!
