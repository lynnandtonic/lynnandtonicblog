Recently I purchased this [35mm camera](http://photojojo.com/store/awesomeness/wide-angle-slim/) from Photojojo.com. I wanted a light-weight and fun camera for weekend photos. Although digital is super easy and much more practical, I like the whimsy and surprise that you get from traditional photo development. I was still testing the light I would need for this camera, and several of my photos just didn’t have enough. Even still, I love the contrast and low-fi pictures that it produced. The last few photos of the roll were exposed accidentally, adding yet another surprise effect.
