My brother introduced me to the Kong dog brush and it’s pretty incredible. It has really helped with Boomer’s shedding. I brush her with it about 4 times a week and each time, handfuls of hair are picked up. It claims to work well for long-haired dogs, but I can’t verify that from experience. For short-haired dogs like Boomer, it is amazing! The brush is on sale from Petco.com for only $7.97: [KONG Zoom Groom Brush at PETCO](http://www.petco.com/product/100491/KONG-Zoom-Groom-Brush.aspx).
