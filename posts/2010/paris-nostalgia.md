It’s been almost five years since the summer I spent in Paris, France. I’ve been feeling pretty nostalgic lately, especially about this incredible trip. If you ever have the chance to go to Paris, I highly recommend it. Paris has hundreds of museums, including three of the most impressive ones I’ve ever visited: Musée d'Orsay, Centre Pompidou, and of course Musée Du Louvre. The food was amazing and the architecture was beautiful. Sitting in a cafe for hours was all we needed on a Saturday afternoon. I truly can’t wait to get back there and soak up all the city has to offer.
