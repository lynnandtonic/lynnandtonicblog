I recently fell in love with these [linen pin boards](http://www.potterybarn.com/products/large-linen-pinboard/?pkey=call-wall-decor-mirrors) from Pottery Barn. They serve a functional purpose while bringing some soft texture into any room. I didn’t, however, fall in love with the price tag. They’re currently on sale, but regular price will run you $99 for a small one and $149 for a large. I decided to try and make my own in hopes of saving some money.

I looked around at a couple office supply and craft stores. I found the best solution at Joann Fabrics: Flip Side cork panels measuring at 16"x36". I wanted the pin boards to be light-weight, but also to have some depth. I bought two on sale for $7.99 each. I also purchased some linen fabric (1.5 yards) for $14.99. If you want to save even more money, you can get linen-feel fabric for less. I wrapped the cork panels in the fabric and stapled it to the back. I used heavy duty mounting tape to place them on the wall and decorated with clear push pins, binder clips, photos, artwork, and memorabilia from past traveling.

Total cost was about $35 and I think it looks great. It was super quick and easy and really adds a lot to the space.
