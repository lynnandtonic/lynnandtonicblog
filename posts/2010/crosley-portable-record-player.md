I decided to hit the ground running on my [26 before 26](/2010/08/22/26-before-26/) list. I’m crossing off #7: <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Get a record player</span>.

I used to own a record player, but gave it to my former roommate when I moved out. I didn’t know where I’d be living permanently and just didn’t have the space. (It was a console with built in speakers, about the size of a low dresser.) I’d been planning on getting another one, but didn’t know what kind. I wanted something small and portable and didn’t want to hook it up to a sound system. I searched online and decided on the [Crosley AV Portable USB Turntable](http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?itemdescription=true&itemCount=80&startValue=1&selectedProductColor=&sortby=&id=15299514&parentid=A_ENT_ELECTRONICS_TURNTABLES&sortProperties=+subCategoryPosition,+product.marketingPriority&navCount=420&navAction=poppushpush&color=&pushId=A_ENT_ELECTRONICS_TURNTABLES&popId=APARTMENT_MEDIA&prepushId=&selectedProductSize=) from Urban Outfitters.

After bringing it home, I pulled out my collection of pop-punk records and finally sorted through the box of LPs I’d been storing in my hall closet. About a year ago, my best friend’s dad was planning on dumping all of his vinyl so I took it off his hands. There are a few gems in there, so I’m glad I did. After a few plays, I’m definitely happy with my purchase. It’s not the best sound quality and any audiophile would probably sneer at it. But listening to Simon and Garfunkel has never been quite so fun. I do wish there was a speaker in the front, but it fills my small living room well.
