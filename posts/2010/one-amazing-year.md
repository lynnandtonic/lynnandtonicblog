One year ago today, we brought Boomer home from the Humane Society. Steve and Vanessa drove us around the entire Phoenix metropolitan area that day, trying to find a dog we could connect with. We were just about to give up when we saw her. Her name was Lola then, and she charmed all of us with her sweet ears and rambunctious personality. Sheâ€™s added so much to our lives and we are so glad we kept looking for her. This is a picture I took of her on her first day home. Happy Adoption Day, Boomer!
