Regrettably crossing off another item on my [26 before 26](/2010/08/22/26-before-26/) list, #15: <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Watch <em>The Godfather</em></span>. I’ve never been a fan of old movies or mob stories, but I thought I couldn’t truly claim that until I saw **_THE_** old mob movie. _The Godfather_ is at or near the top of every “see before you die” list, so I figured I’d better.

Unfortunately, I didn’t really enjoy the film. I found it pretty boring and the characters difficult to understand, both audibly and personally. I’m not sure what all the fuss is about, and now I’m pretty confident in saying mob stories just aren’t for me. I did enjoy James Caan’s horribly fake fight scene, though.
