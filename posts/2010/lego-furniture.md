Iâ€™ve seen quite a bit of functional LEGO sculptures and especially love custom built LEGO furniture. This LEGO coffee table is pretty awesome, albeit expensive. The writers of Humble Ablog set out to create a LEGO replica of the [George Nelson Platform Bench](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_oJw78eKKtpk/S58WNLLj_bI/AAAAAAAABw0/LXgE4aE-6Nw/s1600-h/HMbench.jpg) by Herman Miller. They had to buy each brick individually at 10-26 cents apiece (yikes!). Regardless, the outcome is impressive: a functional piece of furniture that looks beautiful from afar and amazingly whimsical up close.
