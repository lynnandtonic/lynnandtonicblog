![Angels and Airwaves renewed my faith in God and love](/img/postsecret-ava.jpg)

I’ve been listening to a lot of Angels and Airwaves. Well, more than usual anyway. Their new album _LOVE_ was released for free download through their website on Valentine’s Day. It’s pretty incredible and I would recommend everyone take a listen. My favorite song so far is _Epic Holiday_. They are playing the Marquee in Tempe on May 25th and I can’t wait!

The image above is a post secret from 2008. I thought it really summed up what AVA is all about, at least for me. It’s as we often joke, “the kind of music that can cure diseases.”
