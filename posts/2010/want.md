Of course, when we decorate our homes, money is one of the biggest issues to consider. I have a small list of things Iâ€™d absolutely love to have... if price were no matter.

This soaking tub, from Restoration Hardware, is just beautiful. Having a roomy bathroom, with separate tub and shower would be a joy. All I want to do is put on some Jets to Brazil and soak in a relaxing bubble bath.
