The newest adaptation of our favorite thief and archer, _Robin Hood_, featuring Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett is due for release this upcoming weekend. I’m still trying to decide if I’m excited about it or indifferent to the idea of another boring Russell Crowe film. I love the story of Robin Hood and usually love an action-packed period piece. However, anyone deciding to tackle the beloved story must face the comparison with the two best Robin Hood movies ever made:

If it can’t compare with Disney’s _Robin Hood_ or Mel Brooks’s _Robin Hood: Men In Tights_, then is it really worth seeing?
