By far the most frequently visited post on this blog is from this past April on [Exposed Bulb Fixtures](/2010/04/30/exposed-bulb-fixtures/). I really love the look and canâ€™t seem to get enough of them. It looks like the trend is clustered fixtures, providing impact through numbers. Here are a few I think are really charming and would be _so fun_ to have in my home.
