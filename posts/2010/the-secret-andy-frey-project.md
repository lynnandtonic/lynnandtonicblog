Several months ago a friend of mine commissioned a painting. He wanted a fun composition that featured his favorite cartoon characters. He came up with the idea of placing them within the famous _Dogs Playing Poker_. I thought the idea was so fun and the project was a pleasure to complete. It took me a while to get motivated, but I think the final painting turned out great.
