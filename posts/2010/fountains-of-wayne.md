Yesterday my brother and I drove out to Los Angeles to fulfill a dream of mine and to cross off another item on my [26 before 26](/2010/08/22/26-before-26/) list, #9: <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">See Fountains of Wayne in concert</span>.

I first fell in love with Fountains of Wayne 13 years ago. Their self-titled album was the perfect blend of emotion, humor, and power pop. They had me instantly. As I grew up, they delivered three more amazing studio albums and a 2-disc b-sides album with songs to fit every mood and experience.

For reasons unknown, I let these 13 years pass without ever seeing them live. Their touring schedule is usually light and mostly dedicated to the east coast. When I saw they were going to be playing at the famous Troubadour in West Hollywood, I jumped at the opportunity. I’m happy to say it was completely worth it. They played several of my favorite songs and even a few new ones. It’s really unbelievable how many awesome songs they’ve written and how much I still love each one. I can’t wait for their new album to release and to see them again as soon as possible.

I snapped a few photos before the show, but was so enamored with their performance that I forgot to take any photos during. Also, the Troubadour is an amazing venue!
