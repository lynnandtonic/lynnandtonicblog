Seriously considering getting this: a dog bowl tray from [A La Mode Dog](http://www.alamodedog.com/). It features two seamlessly, built-in dog bowls with removable interior dishes. The bottom of the tray is skid-free and will keep your dogâ€™s bowls in place. It also has an outer lip to catch any spilled water. Boomer is the messiest drinker in the world and also pushes her bowl around while she eats. She and I could definitely benefit from this product. And it looks great too!
