Now you can fulfill two fantasies at once: being Asian and being a Jedi. I didnâ€™t think eating sushi or noodles could get any better, but these really bring the fun. You can get a set of two for $19.99 on [amazon.com](http://shop.starwars.com/catalog/product.xml?topcatID=1300264;product_id=1320650).
