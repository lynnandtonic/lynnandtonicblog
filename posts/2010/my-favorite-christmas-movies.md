We all have a list of our favorite Christmas movies: the kind that get us in the spirit and remind us of the magic we felt opening our gifts on Christmas morning. Here are my absolute favorites. Although I do love many classics not on this list (_A Christmas Story_, _National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation_, and _A Charlie Brown Christmas_, to name a few), these are the ones that really remind me of why I love the holiday. I grew up watching many of these every year and they bring back all the memories of my childhood Christmases. The holiday really snuck up on me this year, but I do plan on watching a few of these while wrapping up all the presents.
