I distinctly remember one afternoon in Paris when I noticed an amazingly captivating painting through a gallery window. The gallery was closed for a late lunch and I couldnâ€™t see any names or hints as to who the artist was. I shot a photo of it and would go back to it again and again.

Finally, five years later, I discovered who the artist was. Her name is Francoise Nielly; she lives and paints out of Montmartre in Paris. She creates beautifully haunting portraits with swift strokes of her palette knife. I am simply in love with her style and am glad I could finally see the whole scope of her work.
