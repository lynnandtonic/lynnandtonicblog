_Scott Pilgrim vs the World_ is sort of amazing. It features the lovely and awkward Michael Cera as our protagonist who must battle his dream girl’s 7 evil exes. I love the video game elements scattered throughout the film, the epic battle scenes, and the hilarious dialogue. There were several parts where I found it difficult to stop laughing. The film is fun for fun’s sake and should be seen by anyone who loves awesomeness. Especially wonderful are Kieran Culkin as Scott’s gay roommate Wallace and Ellen Wong as Scott’s fake high school girlfriend Knives Chau.
