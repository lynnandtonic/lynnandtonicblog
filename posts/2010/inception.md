I just got back from seeing _Inception_ and I have to say it’s pretty incredible. I truthfully don’t want to say much about it, as the slow discovery of the plot adds a lot to the experience. I will say that I watched the film with my jaw dropped open for almost its entirety. The concept is so unbelievably complex, yet familiar. We’ve all had dreams, especially ones that felt so real they could have been. The acting is superb and the visual effects flawless and unobtrusive. Fun extras include a visit to the ice planet Hoth and the longest van crash in the history of the world.
