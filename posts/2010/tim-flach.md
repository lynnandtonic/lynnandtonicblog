When I was young, my two favorite animals were wolves and horses. My walls were covered with posters and I had several plastic toys I lovingly displayed. When I saw photographer Tim Flach’s portfolio, I instantly felt a connection. He photographs animals of all varieties, but I found his photos of horses and wolves to be most intriguing. We see a lot of wolf and horse artwork here in Phoenix, and still, Tim Flach’s work is beautiful and captivating.
