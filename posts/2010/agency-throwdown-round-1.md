Last night meltmedia took part in Agency Throwdown, a little bowling competition between creative agencies here in Phoenix. There was plenty of smack talk to go around, but melt came out on top. Over half of the company showed up, including two cheerleaders: one tall, one short and wearing a pink meltmedia cape. Terralever was terrified after we sent them a pre-game video (can be seen [here](http://www.agencythrowdown.com/)) and only 3 members of their team showed up. Luckily 3 guys from Arkayne stepped in to help. It was a blast and I canâ€™t wait until the next one.
