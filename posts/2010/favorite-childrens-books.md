Recently a few of our friends have announced they are expecting, and it got me thinking about baby shower gifts. Instead of the usual onesie or bottle, I think it’d be neat to receive books to fill the future child’s library. I’m sure everyone has different books they cherish from their childhood that would make for great gifts. Here are a few of my favorite early childhood books that I memorized and looked through over and over.

![The Little Mouse, The Red Ripe Strawberry, and The Big Hungry Bear, Amelia Bedelia, The Stinky Cheese Man, Angelina Ballerina, Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day, Caps for Sale, The Berenstain Bears and Too Much Junk Food, Hop on Pop, The Giving Tree, Ferdinand, Love You Forever, Chicka Chicka Boom Boom](/img/childrensbooks.jpg)
