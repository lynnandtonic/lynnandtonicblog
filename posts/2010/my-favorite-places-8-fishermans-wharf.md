Most of my family lives in or around the San Francisco area. I’ve been visiting the city ever since I can remember. One of my very favorite things has always been taking the cable car to Fisherman’s Wharf and Pier 39. My family and I would spend the afternoon there, eating clam chowder in sourdough bread bowls, watching the sea lions sleep in the sun, and browsing the seaside stores. It’s only a short walk to Ghirardelli Square and short ferry rides to Alcatraz and Angel Island. The seafood is exceptional and the ocean breeze refreshing. There’s something relaxing and comforting about Fisherman’s Wharf. It’s a fun escape from the city where you can enjoy the smell and sound of the ocean and the taste of authentic salt water taffy. Every time we visit San Francisco, we always manage to squeeze in a trip to the wharf. Who knows, one of these days I may even face my fears and visit their famous aquarium.
