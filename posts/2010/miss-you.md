There are some people who, even in a short amount of time, can impact your life forever. Three years later, I still think of you often. I miss you, your amazing stories, and your comforting warmth. I hope you are somewhere entertaining the masses with your astounding intelligence and acerbic wit. And I hope you didnâ€™t have to go back through security.
