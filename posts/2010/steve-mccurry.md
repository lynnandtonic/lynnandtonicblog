I saw this blog entry over at [mymodernmet.com](http://www.mymodernmet.com/profiles/blogs/22-incredible-photos-of) that features 22 incredible photos from faraway places. The photos of Steve McCurry are beyond incredible. He is best known for his photograph of the Afghan refugee girl who graced the cover of _National Geographic_ and became their “most recognized photograph.” These three photos were my favorites posted on that blog. After looking through McCurry’s website portfolio, I wanted to post about 200 more. To avoid the agonizing task of choosing my favorites from there, I recommend you visit his site immediately and be amazed. He can truly capture the beauty of the human spirit.
