Crate and Barrel just recently announced its line of pet products. There aren’t many so far, but what I’ve seen, I like. I especially love the houndstooth patterns and sophisticated style. For some reason they only carry large and small dog collars, beds, and bowls. I’m not sure if Boomer would fit either of those sizes, but I’d love to get her the green polka dot collar. So cute!
