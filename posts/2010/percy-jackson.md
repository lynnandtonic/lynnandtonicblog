Last night we went to see _Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightening Thief_ and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Not only do I have a special place in my heart for Greek mythology, I especially love modern interpretations of the stories. The movie was fun and had a lot of talented actors in the cast. Sean Bean, Kevin McKidd, and Steve Coogan played Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades respectively. Rosario Dawson played a sassy Persephone and Uma Thurman did a great job as Medusa.

The only problem I had with the film (and I’m pretty sure it’s more of a beef with the author of the book) was that Zeus was missing his _lightening_ bolt and not his properly accurate _thunder_bolt. Even Disney’s _Hercules_ got it right. Other than this whiny criticism of the film/book, I really liked it and recommend that everyone see it!
