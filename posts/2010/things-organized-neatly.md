What a brilliant idea. As an avid organizer, I never imagined that simply _looking_ at neatly organized items could actually relax me. [Things Organized Neatly](http://thingsorganizedneatly.tumblr.com/) features photos of objects placed in evenly spaced and pleasingly aligned arrangements. It demonstrates that grouping similar objects together is an easy and quick way to organize. It also proves you shouldnâ€™t assume, even though a space appears cluttered, that it is also unorganized (and vice versa).
