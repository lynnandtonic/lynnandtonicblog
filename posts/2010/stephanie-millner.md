Pet owners everywhere can agree that our pets truly become parts of our families. 80% of the pictures on my phone are of my dog Boomer and whenever I look at them I feel so happy. These photos are from Stephanie Millner, a photographer currently living in Italy. She really captures the personality of her subjects and honors our furry friends. Iâ€™d love to have a photo session with her and Boomer!
