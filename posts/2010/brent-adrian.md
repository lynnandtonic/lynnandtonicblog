Another amazing artist I crossed paths with while at ASU is Brent Adrian. He creates beautiful, up-close paintings of different varieties of animal flesh. The compositions are cropped so the larger forms are often unknown. We are left to examine the detailed textures: the softness of feathers, the slime of fat, and the wrinkles of skin. If you have an opportunity to see his paintings in person, I strongly encourage it. The delicately built-up layers are a joy to see.
