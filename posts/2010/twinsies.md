Every Sunday I look through [Post Secret](http://www.postsecret.com/) and occasionally I’ll see a secret I can relate to. This Sunday, however, I saw a secret that I could have written and sent in myself. Here is that secret plus a tweet I posted earlier this year in March. It’s always fun to see how similar we can be, even as strangers.
