Guerra de la Paz is the collaboration between two Cuban-born artists, Alain Guerra and Neraldo de la Paz. They create sculptures from found objects and recycled clothing. A lot of their work is politically themed, which doesnâ€™t really interest me. But I am quite drawn to the forms they make with clothing.
