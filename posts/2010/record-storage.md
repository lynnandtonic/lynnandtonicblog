With the purchase of a record player, I now had to find a storage solution for the records. I searched online for a few days, trying to find the right compromise between form and function. Because I wanted to keep the records close to the player in the living room, I thought a furniture-style option would be best. My first choice would have been the [IKEA Expedit Bookcase](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/categories/series/09064/), but it doesn’t come in a two-cubby option. I finally settled on [Galvanized Storage Cubes](http://www.containerstore.com/shop/shelvingSale/modularSteelCubes?N=13373) from the Container Store.

The cubes connect together to make various storage combinations and can be fitted with shelves, doors, and castors. I picked up two cubes and two perforated steel doors. Thankfully, they are on sale right now for the annual shelving sale event. Putting the cubes together was actually pretty painful. The pieces are difficult to fit together and have sharp edges. The doors were by far the most annoying and require a decent amount of strength and dexterity. Now that they’re put together, though, I think it was a good choice. The records fit in there perfectly, although I may add some tension rods for some extra support. I also added two of the cube connectors to the top so I could easily display the record in use.
