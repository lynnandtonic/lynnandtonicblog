Crossing off another item on my [26 before 26](/2010/08/22/26-before-26/) list, #26: <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Create wedding books for my parents and in-laws</span>.

For two years, I’ve been meaning to make a wedding scrapbook of some sort for my parents and Clay’s parents. Scrapbooks can sometimes look cheesy or too craftsy, so I decided to use Apple’s iPhoto printing services. It’s quick, easy, and looks great. I’ll be sending these out this weekend and I hope they like them!
