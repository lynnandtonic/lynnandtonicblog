I saw these book covers on [Design\*Sponge](http://www.designspongeonline.com/) and immediately fell in love. They are designed by [Coralie Bickford-Smith](http://www.cb-smith.com/index.php?/clothbound/f-scott-fitzgerald/) and they are beautiful. Not only do I love F. Scott Fitzgerald, but I love the graphic, metallic patterns. All I really have to say is O.M.G.
