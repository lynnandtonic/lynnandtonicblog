I don’t know much about photography and tend to judge photographs solely on how much I enjoy looking at them. My friend Tiffany’s friend Jesse O’Driscoll keeps a daily photo blog and it is BEAUTIFUL. He is super talented and I absolutely love the work he posts. It feels effortless and natural. Here are a few of my favorites and you can take a look at his blog to see the rest.
