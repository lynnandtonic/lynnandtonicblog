I make this dip for parties and always get a great response. I thought I’d post the recipe so everyone can make it for their own get-togethers. It’s super easy and very delicious!

Ingredients:  
\- 2 blocks Philadelphia original cream cheese  
\- small container Daisy original sour cream  
\- 2 cans of Macayo’s diced green chilies (4oz each)  
\- jar of roasted red peppers (I use Mt. Olive brand, found in the condiments aisle by the olives)

<p class="number number-01"><strong>Put cream cheese blocks into a large bowl or Pyrex container.</strong> Microwave for 1-3 minutes until the cream cheese is soft enough to mix easily.</p>
<p class="number number-02"><strong>Put two large scoops of sour cream into bowl.</strong> I use just a normal soup spoon. If you want to cut the sharpness of the cream cheese, add more sour cream.</p>
<p class="number number-03"><strong>Chop roasted red peppers and add to bowl.</strong> I use about the equivalent of one red pepper. Of course, you can always add more.</p>
<p class="number number-04"><strong>Open green chilies and add to bowl. </strong>Do not drain chilies. The juice will only add to the flavor of the dip.</p>
<p class="number number-05"><strong>Mix dip.</strong> You want the dip to have a light peach color (from the red pepper juice runoff). Mix until there is no more bright white from the cream cheese and sour cream and the texture is consistent. </p>
<p class="number number-06"><strong>Put bowl in the fridge overnight.</strong> Resist the urge to eat it right away. Trust me, it will taste much better if it has time to sit and cool properly. Enjoy!</p>

For the health conscious, you can sub low-fat or fat-free cream cheese and sour cream. I do warn you though, that it really doesn’t taste as good.
