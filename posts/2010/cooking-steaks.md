Crossing off another item on my [26 before 26](/2010/08/22/26-before-26/) list, #25: <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Learn to properly cook a steak</span>. I was very fortunate growing up that I had two parents who knew how to cook well. I do regret not learning more from them, so I’ve decided to start. The first and easiest cooking technique, I thought, would be learning how to make steak like they do: always juicy and delicious. My dad walked me through the marinade, the grill, and monitoring temperatures. It was easier than I’d thought and they turned out amazing. I can’t wait to start cooking more at home!
