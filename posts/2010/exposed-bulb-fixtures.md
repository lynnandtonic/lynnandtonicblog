Earlier this week, a friend of mine pointed out some beautiful, exposed-bulb light fixtures at the restaurant at which we were dining. This style has the raw feeling of antique lighting and the minimalist appeal of modern design. Flipping through a few of my favorite home catalogs, I noticed even more lighting that showcased exposed bulbs. I really like the look, especially when several are grouped together. Here are a few I found that could add charm to any home.
