When I saw these photos of the IKEA advertisements in the Paris Metro, my heart fluttered and my knees felt weak. These are two of my favorite places: spots perfect for casual afternoons, people watching, and feeling instantly happier. When I spent my summer in Paris, I would often ride the Metro around town and discover hidden and beautiful places to sit, eat, and shop. It was a perfect way to quickly and conveniently absorb Parisian life. As for IKEA, I find myself going there on weekends to simply walk around and look at their displays. Itâ€™s one of my favorite places to relieve stress and rearrange my thoughts. Check out these amazing IKEA installations at recognizable Metro stops.
