Clay and I have a new addition to our family. To make a long, confusing story short, we are taking custody of my brother’s recently adopted dog from the Humane Society. We named him Helo and we think he’s part miniature pinscher, chihuahua, and dachshund. He’s spunky and quite the cuddler. Boomer is still getting used to having another dog in the house, but we’re hoping they’ll quickly become friends.
