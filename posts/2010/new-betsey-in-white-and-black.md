I regularly lurk Betsey Johnson’s website in hopes that I will soon have an occasion and the money to purchase one of her dresses. I bought a basic black dress from her store for my college graduation and I still love it. It’s perfect for casual or dressy events and it’s super comfortable. I don’t dress up often, as I prefer jeans and t-shirts, but I do occasionally like to get dolled up. These two new dresses caught my eye and I can only imagine how much fun I could have wearing them.
