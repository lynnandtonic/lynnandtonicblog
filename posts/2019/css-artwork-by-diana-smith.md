UI developer [Diana Smith](https://twitter.com/cyanharlow) is also an amazing artist. She creates detailed, beautiful portraits using only HTML and CSS. She captures the glow of skin and the life behind it in the way many painters which they could. And itâ€™s all done in code. Truly magnificent work.
