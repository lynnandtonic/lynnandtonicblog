This list was much harder to make than [my favorite movies of 2019](/2019/12/23/my-favorite-movies-of-2019/). I was able to get it down to 15 and that’s how many [Chris Coyier did](https://chriscoyier.net/2019/11/11/my-favorites-movies-of-the-2010s/), so I figured that’s great.

It was especially difficult because movies released earlier in the decade have the advantage of nostalgia and repeat viewings. I might revisit this in 5 years to see how my opinions change.
