Clay and I are finally settled at home after spending a week crossing off another item on my [30 Before 30](/2012/04/13/30-before-30/) list, #14: <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Take a road trip</span>.

We drove up through the middle of California to the Pacific Northwest. After a few amazing days in Portland and Seattle, we drove back to Phoenix by way of Boise and eastern Nevada. We didn’t have many plans and although I was a little anxious, it worked out wonderfully. We made sure to stop at silly roadside attractions and to relax when we wanted to. We also enjoyed amazing food in every city we visited.

Here is a whole bunch of photos from the road!
