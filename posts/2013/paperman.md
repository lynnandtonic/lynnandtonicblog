If you saw _Wreck-it Ralph_, I hope you also got there early enough to see the Disney animated short _Paperman_. Actually, hold up. If you haven’t seen _Wreck-it Ralph_, find a way to see it immediately. I don’t care if the closest theater playing it is 150 miles away. I promise it will be worth it.

But if you’d still like to wait until it’s released for purchase, you can breathe easy knowing you can watch _Paperman_ on the interwebz for free. It has incredibly beautiful animation and an equally charming story. Disney has been putting out top-notch work the last few years and I can’t get enough.
