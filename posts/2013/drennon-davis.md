Over the holiday, Clay and I visited family in San Francisco. While there was plenty of food and games to go around, we also saw a handful of really entertaining shows. We visited Cobb’s Comedy Club to see the Daily Show’s John Oliver, with Alex Koll and Drennon Davis opening.

I’m happy to say they were all hilarious and it was probably one of the best stand-up shows I’ve seen live. Drennon Davis does _the Imaginary Radio_ and it’s not only musically impressive, but super freaking funny. Here are two songs we couldn’t stop giggling about. And I dare you to get the baby deer song out of your head.
