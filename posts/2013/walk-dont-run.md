I’m stretching this a little bit, but it’s my list so who cares! I’m crossing off another item on my [30 Before 30](/2012/04/13/30-before-30/) list, #26: <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Run every day for a month</span>. Just replace “Run” with “Walk a shit ton.”

Last month we had a FitBit walking competition. The person with the most steps in 4 weeks would walk away the winner. I decided to go all out and win by as many steps as I possibly could. Before the competition I averaged around 5,000 steps per day. And during, I averaged about 30,000. In 4 weeks I racked up 830,631 steps and took first place!

Even though it wasn’t running, I definitely pushed myself. I spent most of my free time walking and even walked the 9 miles to work a few times. It was exhausting and my feet weren’t happy with me, but it was really fun. I’ve been taking the past week off, but I’m excited to get going again!
