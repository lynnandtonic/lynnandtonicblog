On my down time I’ve been catching up on the past few seasons of Project Runway. I loved the first two seasons of All Stars. It’s cool to see how the designers have changed (or not changed) and fun to see more from old favorites. Love Mondo of course; I’m so glad he won. I wish Andrae could have made it further. Although he isn’t quite as fun without Santino. Here are some of my favorite looks from these two seasons!

You may also want to see my favorite looks from: [Seasons 1 and 2](/2011/01/31/best-of-project-runway-seasons-1-and-2/), [Seasons 3 and 4](/2011/02/07/best-of-project-runway-seasons-3-and-4/), [Seasons 5 and 6](/2011/02/13/best-of-project-runway-seasons-5-and-6/), [Seasons 7 and 8](/2011/03/03/best-of-project-runway-seasons-7-and-8/), and [Seasons 9 and 10](/2012/10/25/best-of-project-runway-seasons-9-and-10/).
