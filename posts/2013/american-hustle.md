Clay and I spent Christmas Eve with my parents, eating a delicious dinner at Cafepino and then seeing _American Hustle_ at the Cine Capri. I’d already heard some amazing reviews of the film, especially that the acting was beyond superb. And they weren’t kidding.

_American Hustle_ follows confidence man Irving Rosenfeld and his lover Sydney Prosser, played by Christian Bale and Amy Adams, as they find themselves helping FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) catch other white collar criminals. The film relies on exceptional acting and little else. Christian Bale is so good, both physically and emotionally transforming. And Jennifer Lawrence is pure perfection, as usual.

Besides the acting, the story is compelling and the ending is definitely worth the journey. And a delightful performance from Louis C.K. will keep you smiling. I definitely recommend it.
