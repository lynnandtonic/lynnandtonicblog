This weekend family and friends gathered at my parents’ home in Scottsdale to celebrate my dad’s 65th birthday. It was great to see everyone and to enjoy some delicious food. The weather was absolutely perfect! And, even though it was my dad’s party, my little nephew Henry sure did steal the show. I’m so grateful for such a wonderful father and to be surrounded by such awesome people.
