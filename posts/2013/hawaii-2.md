Earlier this month we had an amazing time in Hawaii to celebrate our fifth wedding anniversary. We stayed in the Ko Olina Beach Villas and it was just as relaxing as we hoped! We spent plenty of time at the beach, visited the Dole pineapple plantation, ate at the shrimp trucks in North Shore, and toured the USS Missouri. Here are a few instagrams from the trip!
