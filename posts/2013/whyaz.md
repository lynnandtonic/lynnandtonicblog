A project I’ve been working on with [meltmedia](http://meltmedia.com) launched yesterday. It’s called WhyAZ and shares the many reasons we love living and working in Arizona.

The site was incredibly fun to make. It was designed entirely in the browser and all the graphical elements are drawn with CSS. You can view the site at [why.az](http://why.az) and read more about the process on my website: [Why WhyAZ?](https://lynnandtonic.com/thoughts/entries/why-whyaz/)
