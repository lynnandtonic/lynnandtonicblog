Yesterday we went to see _Paper Heart_ at Camelview. I had pretty high expectations for this movie and I am glad to say I loved it. Charlyne Yi plays a fictionalized version of herself, heading across the country to learn about love. The relationships in the movie are endearing and real, especially the friendship between Charlyne and director Nick Jasenovec. The best parts of the film are the love stories depicted through paper cutouts and puppets. The dialogue is hilarious and Charlyne and Michael’s awkward relationship makes for a sweet and entertaining film.

Plus, she is my doppelganger.
