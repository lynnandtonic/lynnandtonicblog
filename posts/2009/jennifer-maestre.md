Jennifer Maestre is a sculptor who creates intricate sea-urchin inspired forms out of the tips of colored pencils. Her work is absolutely beautiful and requires a second look. The pieces become even more amazing and detailed as you examine more closely. It reminds me of a project we did in my Painting 1 class in school where we needed to make an ordinary object extraordinary. I love it!
