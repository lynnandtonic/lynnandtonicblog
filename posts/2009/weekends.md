This weekend has been quite satisfactory indeed. Friday night Clay and I went to see _Year One_. It was pretty funny, but very raunchy. I should have expected it, but some parts were pretty gross. I do love Jack Black and Michael Cera.

Yesterday Vanessa and I got an early start and met my Mom at West Elm for a design seminar. They showed us how to transition our home interiors from summer to fall. I’ve never changed my decorations based on the season and I really don’t see myself doing so in the future, but I did like seeing their choice of accessories. I ended up buying a dining table for us, and it is cute!

Afterwards, Vanessa and I got some delicious YC’s and ventured to IKEA. You can always count on IKEA. Then we picked up Clay and went to see _Away We Go_. It was so good! Funny and sad and very real. John Krasinski is great.

Before the movie, we saw the preview for _Paper Heart_ with Michael Cera and Charlyne Yi. It looks amazing. It is pretty much me and Clay. Also, I remember like ten different people telling me that I was in _Knocked Up_. I didn’t think I resembled her that much then, but now I can see it.
