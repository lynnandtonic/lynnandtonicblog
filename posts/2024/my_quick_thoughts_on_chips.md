Just joining the chip conversation that [Dave Rupert](https://daverupert.com/2023/08/quick-thoughts-on-chips/), [Jonathan Snook](https://snook.ca/archives/personal/quicker-thoughts-on-chips), and [Peter Mullen](https://pmullen.com/posts/more-quick-thoughts-on-chips/) have been bloggin’ on their own blogs.

I am not very opinionated on what gets called a chip, so covering “snacks” here too.

__1. Tortilla chips should be as thin as possible.__
Some chip breakage is just expected. Blue corn > white corn > yellow corn.

__2. Ruffles are made for dip.__
Any non-nacho dip should be eaten with Ruffles. Wavy Lays not accepted.

__3. Salsa Verde Doritos are best.__ Pair with (Diet) Dr. Pepper.

__4. Pretzels are good if classic Snyder’s of Hanover.__
Others accepted if covered in yogurt or milk chocolate. The only flavored pretzels are Dot’s honey mustard.

__5. Burgers should not be served with chips.__
Sandwiches should be served with kettle-style chips. Unless a Subway sandwich, then crunchy Cheetos.

__6. Pringles are for eating on a boat on a lake.__ Fits perfectly in a cup holder and floats.

__7. All chips taste better in the car.__ Road trip meal.
