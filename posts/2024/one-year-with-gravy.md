Today weâ€™re celebrating Gravyâ€™s adoption day. Itâ€™s been a hard, joyful, and fulfilling year with this little dude.

The first few months were admittedly hard for me. I didnâ€™t realize how my grief from losing [Boomer](/2023/03/21/boomer-3/) and [Helo](/2023/01/03/helo-3/) would present and I struggled with [puppy blues](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/puppy-blues/) for weeks. It was a weird mix of sadness, guilt, and regret and it was rough.

Gravy is a sweetheart, but definitely a different type of personality than we were used to. A sensitive and scared boy, he needed extra time and especially space to learn to trust us. Heâ€™s firm with his boundaries and doesnâ€™t like to be held or showered with affection. You donâ€™t realize how often you kiss your dog on the head until you have a dog that doesnâ€™t like it. ðŸ˜…

But with the help of a [local dog behaviorist](https://natedogtraining.com/) and with lots of time, weâ€™ve built a strong connection and heâ€™s blossoming into such a curious, loving, and happy guy. It took 11 months, but he now wants to sleep in the bed with us. Every day he gets braver, more excitable, and more affectionate and itâ€™s been really wonderful watching that happen.

From day one he was a really good walker. Very calm and polite and itâ€™s been a joy to take him on hikes and through the horse trails in the neighborhood next to ours.

He loves playing tug and catching a lure, wrapping his foot around it to keep us from taking it again.

He hates the rain, but loves being outside as much as possible.

His favorite thing is to help you with a task, inspecting every weed you pull or supervising as you put together IKEA furniture. And of course he loves to nip at your heels as you run, herding you around the backyard.

Heâ€™s becoming more of a cuddler with time, but we first really noticed him connecting with us by laying on our feet outside. He keeps close in his own way. I have a hundred pictures just like this. Excuse my socks and sandals.

Things with Gravy feel so comfortable and routine now that I canâ€™t believe I was ever worried. We are loving life with Mr. Boat and we canâ€™t wait to see how he continues to grow and change.
