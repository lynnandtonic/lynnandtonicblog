Way back in April we decided it was time to get [Gravy](/2024/04/20/one-year-with-gravy/) a bud to hang with. We visited the country shelter, scooped up this little lady, and named her Tater.

She was about a year old and found wandering the streets of west Phoenix. It really felt like she had a previous owner as she took to her name immediately, coming to us when called from the very start. She knew how to sit and how to fetch a ball.

We didn’t have any info about her breed, though we assumed some husky because of her blue eyes and curled tail. She’s got a weird build with a long narrow body and oversized head and front paws. She looks like a mishmash of different breed parts.

We had some luck with [Gravy’s DNA test](/2024/02/21/bingo-doggo-dna/) so we submitted one for Tater too.

![Tater is a very fetching mix of 6 breeds! 28.7% American Pit Bull Terrier, 26.5% Siberian Husky, 24% Chihuahua, 7.9% Samoyed, 6.6% Alaskan Malamute, 6.3% German Shepherd Dog](/img/meet-tater13.jpg)

We were surprised by pit bull and laughed because that chihuahua DNA is doing some heavy lifting, keeping her at a small 20lbs. I think she looks like a different breed depending on the angle you look at her.

With her strange proportions, her natural resting position is a sploot. She clumsily flops anywhere and everywhere, almost like her front and back are controlled by two different brains.

She sits on her butt, legs out in front like a person, finding any soft surface she can use as a chair.

Inside her huge head is a giant tongue that flops out when she’s warm and peeks out in some of the cutest bleps you’ve ever seen.

Introducing Tater to Gravy took a bit of work. He’s a nervous pup and she’s just a whirlwind of energy. They’re learning how to chill and play together and it’s been fun watching them navigate their new relationship.

In the mornings Tater is chill and cuddly, earning her the nickname Sweet Potato. And in the late afternoons she’s a total menace and we call her Loaded Baked Potato. She’s got an intense stare and plays with a similar intensity, though she’s surprisingly gentle with children. 

She loves to chew and will eat anything and everything she finds, including feathers, wood, and concrete pieces. Her high-pitched bark will pierce your soul and she’ll chase a squeaky toy until she collapses.

It’s been a fun and challenging six months and every day she’s feeling more and more at home. We’ve been loving our Gravy years so far and we’re very glad Tater’s here now too.
