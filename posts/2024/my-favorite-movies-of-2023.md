This list was harder to narrow down than past years. I saw a lot of good movies, but they all seemed to be the same level of good? No major standouts for me! Because of a difficult first half of the year emotionally, I really gravitated towards comfort films and comedies.

Some honorable mentions include _Bottoms_, _Barbenheimer_, _Missing_ (a spiritual sequel to 2018’s _Searching_), _Across the Spider-Verse_, _Killers of the Flower Moon_, and _Godzilla Minus One_ (which was a surprise for me). I’ve also been really enjoying the _Wonka_ soundtrack. Also Benny Safdie in _Are You There God? It’s Me Margaret_.
