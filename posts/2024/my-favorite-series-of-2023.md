This year I questioned why I only include debuts on this list! Some of my favorite television this year was from returning shows including _The Afterparty_, _Mythic Quest_, and a brilliant season 2 of _The Bear_. That _Forks_ episode, sheesh. I loved the endings for _Succession_, _Never Have I Ever_, and _Loki_ (which really stuck the landing). And of course _LEGO Masters_ is always a bright spot.

Maybe next year I will include returning series, but for now, here are my fave miniseries and series debuts from 2023.
