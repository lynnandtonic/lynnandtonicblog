I’ve been enjoying this season of *Top Chef*, but I’ve also been nervously awaiting this week’s episode. The Quickfire featured the blind taste test (which is always a treat).

A few months ago I got to chat with Kristen Kish and Stephanie Cmar for the aftershow web series [The Dish with Kish](https://www.bravotv.com/top-chef-the-dish-with-kish) and the episode just released! We chatted about my project [Top Chef Stats](https://topchefstats.com/) and I quizzed them on some taste test trivia.

It was overwhelming but fun and a really cool moment for me as a *Top Chef* superfan. You can check out the episode on Peacock or [Bravotv.com](https://www.bravotv.com/top-chef-the-dish-with-kish/season-21/videos/tasting-blind)!
