We just got back from the annual [ui.dev](https://ui.dev/) Disneyland trip and I’m wishing we were still there. We had four park days this trip, so we spent some time doing rides we’ve never done before and trying new foods. We normally survive on churros and corn dogs, so it was fun to mix it up.

Of the new (to us) foods we tried, these were my faves. Some notes and honorable mentions below too.

![1. two tacos, 2. red Mickey shaped macaron filled with raspberries, 3. Dole Whip float with green liquid and two lychee, 4. churro dusted toffee squares, 5. breakfast sandwich with egg, sausage, and a hash brown, 6. cup of orange-ish dip, 7. round, light brown baked good drizzled with icing and peppermint pieces, 8. stir fry dish with rice cakes, cabbage, and shrimp](/img/disney-foods.jpg)

<ol class="numbered">
  <li><strong>QuesaBirria tacos</strong>, Cocina Cucamonga @ DCA <br>Everyone raves about these and they are not wrong. So delicious. I will be thinking about that consomé every day until the next time I have it.</li>
  <li><strong>Raspberry rose macaron</strong>, Jolly Holiday @ Disneyland <br>I’ve actually tried this before, but had to include it. I ate every macaron I could find and this one is the best by a mile.</li>
  <li><strong>The Monstropolis float</strong>, Tropical Hideaway @ Disneyland <br>I love Dole Whip but I usually only want a few bites. I could have eaten this entire float myself (though I shared it with Clay). It’s ube-dusted pineapple/mango Dole Whip, with passion fruit coconut juice and lychee. Incredible. I think it’s a Halloween seasonal item, so hoping it’ll be around again.</li>
  <li><strong>Churro toffee square</strong>, Bakery counters @ both parks <br>Very good, though we had two of varying thickness and I think it works best when the toffee is thinner.</li>
  <li><strong>Breakfast Sandwich</strong>, Smokejumpers @ DCA <br>This was my favorite breakfast item we tried this trip. Sausage, egg, cheese, hash brown, green chile, and a spicy sauce. Ours was piping hot fresh which probably makes a huge difference (we tried the famous chimichanga and it was pretty soggy).</li>
  <li><strong>Buffalo chicken dip</strong>, cart by the castle @ Disneyland<br>Comes with some soft bread. When you need something to dip and are disappointed with the other options. (We did try the new cheese at the Little Red Wagon, but I don’t think it worked with the corn dog. Needs a pretzel or chips.)</li>
  <li><strong>Chocolate peppermint brownie pie</strong>, Bakery counters @ both parks<br>This didn’t taste all that chocolatey to me? But I think it works better that way. Kind of a spiced and mild taste and the peppermint shines.</li>
  <li><strong>Shanghai rice cakes with shrimp</strong>, Din Tai Fung @ Downtown Disney<br>I put this last because maybe it doesn’t count since it’s not technically in the parks. We got take out here and tried a bunch of things. Everything was wonderful, but I especially loved this dish.</li>
</ol>

Some honorable mentions of course include the classic Disneyland churro, the bread bowl of clam chowder, and specifically the cherry garnish on the Vintian mineral mousse @ Docking Bay 7.
