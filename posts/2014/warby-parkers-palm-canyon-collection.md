I’m a sucker for a good pair of glasses. Everyone’s favorite online glasses shop [Warby Parker](http://www.warbyparker.com/eyeglasses) just released their new Palm Canyon Collection. It features their coolest frames with a charming textural update. The details on the frames are made by “melding sheets of woodwork-inspired acetate and tortoise acetate together” and each pair is unique, just like you. Check out the entire collection at [warbyparker.com](http://www.warbyparker.com/eyeglasses).
