There are too many movies! ðŸ˜…

But for real, it was tough keeping up with all the movies. Even in the final days of the year as I was furiously trying to get through my list, I kept discovering more! So thereâ€™s a bunch from 2024 I still want to watch, but Iâ€™m afraid I must call it.

Hoping to do a better job tracking things and actually getting into the cinema in 2025. [Follow me on Letterboxd!](https://letterboxd.com/lynnfisher/)

Some honorable mentions include _Inside Out 2_, _We Live in Time_, _Twisters_, _DÃ¬di_, _Heretic_, Jake Johnsonâ€™s _Self Reliance_, and I had a lot of fun with John Cenaâ€™s _Ricky Stanicky_.
