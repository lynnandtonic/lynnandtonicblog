Our late pup [Helo](/2023/01/03/helo-3/) was precious with his feet. He didn’t like walking on gravel or even grass all that much. He did love to walk on a raised curb like a balance beam.

In our backyard we have two small patches of grass that are bordered by such a curb. Every day, multiple times a day, he would walk the full perimeter. We got to calling it “Helo Trail” and would join him in a single file line.

I wish I had taken more video of him doing it, but this one captures it pretty well.

  <span class='screenreader'>A little brown and black dog walks along a curb edge of grass, crosses a bisecting pathway, and continues along the curb edge of another patch of grass. During his walk along the curb, he notices something in the gravel, steps off for just a moment, then continues on his way. At the end of the curb there is a big rock and he avoids it by stepping into the grass and quickly hopping onto the nearby pavement.</span>

After he passed, it made us feel a tiny bit better to walk Helo Trail each morning. We miss that guy so much, so we decided to make his trail official with a little dedication.

We ordered a custom trail sign from the Etsy shop [SignsbyWoodcarve](https://www.etsy.com/shop/SignsbyWoodcarve) and it came out perfect.

It brings us daily joy to see this little reminder of him. Occasionally Gravy or Tater will walk the trail and our hearts swell all over again.
