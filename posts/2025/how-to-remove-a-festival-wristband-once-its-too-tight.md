Hey there, festival goer.

Were you overzealous and put your festival wristband on too early or too tight? Did you skip the instructions telling you not to do that and now the one-way sliding clip of death is the bane of your existence?

Don’t fret. Let’s get that wristband off without destroying it.

If you’ve landed here, maybe you’ve already seen people suggest the [straw technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R15p4rbZyLg) or the [twist technique](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/UerM7XdeaAk). Those didn’t work for us either.

What did ultimately work was a soapy ziploc bag technique, as illustrated below.

First, smear some hand soap on your hand and wrist underneath the wristband.

Next, slip your hand into a sandwich-sized ziploc bag. Squeeze the bag’s zipper top under the wristband all the way around your wrist. The bag should now be between your skin and the wristband.

Finally, fold the bag zipper top down over the wristband and pull toward your fingers. The soapy bag should slip right off.

Once the wristband is off, _now_ you can do the [straw technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R15p4rbZyLg) to loosen the clip for later use.

Hopefully now you are filled with joy and relief. But if this technique doesn’t work, I do not know what else to tell you. Sorry! Enjoy your festival.
