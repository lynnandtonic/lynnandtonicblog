Lately Iâ€™ve been feeling similarly about TV series as [I do about movies](/2025/01/07/my-favorite-movies-of-2024/). There are _soo_ many. Truly hard to keep up.

Still, I really try to watch series in the year they debut. With studios canceling shows just weeks after they release them (wtf), I do try to get my views counted. Although that may be fruitless since my #1 fave this year has already been canceled. ðŸ˜­

This year we enjoyed watching all of the available seasons of _For All Mankind_ and a truly exceptional fifth season of _Fargo_. Some honorable mentions are _Death and Other Details_ (already canceled), _Baby Reindeer_, _Agatha All Along_, and _The Brothers Sun_ (also already canceled).

I never know where to put comedy specials, but I also loved Rachel Bloomâ€™s _Death, Let Me Do My Special_ which was theatrical, funny, and heartbreaking.

Good news is that some of these are getting a second season! Here are my fave miniseries and series debuts from 2024.
