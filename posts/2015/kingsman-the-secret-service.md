Colin Firth as a gentleman spy? Yes please. _Kingsman: The Secret Service_ is just awesome, combining great actors, fine suits, comedy, and over-the-top-violent fight scenes. It’s James Bond meets Kick-Ass (basically the only kind of James Bond film I’d be interested in seeing from this point on).

Watch the trailer again and then go see it in theaters immediately.
