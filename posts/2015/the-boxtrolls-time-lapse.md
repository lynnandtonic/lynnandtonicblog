I’ve previously posted the trailer for the Laika stop-motion animated film _The Boxtrolls_ ([watch it here](/2014/01/11/the-boxtrolls/), it’s amazing). Now watch this short time lapse that shows a small fraction of the work involved with putting a film like this together. Impressive to watch and still so charming.
